10. Easy to hold and comfortable in hand
11. Finishing, glossy colour is minimalistic design

Cons:
1. Device is bulky, large and heavy
2. Device become warm in normal use, that affect battery back up a little bit.
3. There is sudden play at back cover(Samsung need to strict its qc team)
4. Device stalls for a bit(2-4seconds, no touch response occurs then everything is ok)) during games and youtube(bug need to fix)

I dont know the problems are only in my unit or other users also facing same problem. When i bought this phone there was only option to return the device no replacement. I don't had spare phone. Thats why I had to keep the device. Amazon executive ran diagnosis test, no problem found. Went to cutomer service. There also no problem found. They updated software and that also can't solve the problems.",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTozMjM1NDkwMDYwMDg5NjkwOjE3MDA2Mzc3MzI6c3BfYXRmOjIwMTQ4MTQ3NDE3OTk4OjowOjo&url=%2FSamsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor%2Fdp%2FB0BZCR6TNK%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dmobile%26qid%3D1700637732%26sr%3D8-1-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1
Trusted reviews,A Solid Choice for Long Phone Calls and Battery Life,Reviewed in India on 16 October 2023,"Before settling on the Samsung M14 5G, I was considering three different models: the Redmi 12 5G, Moto G54 5G, and M14. Through my research, I found that the G54 had heating issues and the Redmi 12 had camera issues. As a general user who was looking for a good phone with good battery life and good call quality, I ultimately chose the M14.

In terms of network capabilities, this phone works best on 5G/4G and supports 13 bands on 5G, VOWIFI, and has 4G aggression which works seamlessly. The only feature missed was VONR. One feature that I found particularly useful is voice focus, which cuts background noise perfectly( particularly when you are train or noisy environment). The phone also has dedicated slots for SIM and SDCard.

Battery backup is amazing and can sustain for at least 2 days no matter how you use it. However, the camera is average and the rear camera is worse than the front camera. The Samsung UI is very good and supports dual apps (dual WhatsApp), and RAM management is good, though most of the time only 2GB of RAM is free. If you have a Samsung TV, this phone works flawlessly with it.

The phone comes with the latest Android 13 out of the box, and Samsung guarantees updates for OS and security updates which is a plus. The speaker is loud enough for calls and listening to YouTube videos. There are no bloatware apps, though there are a few that can be uninstalled.

One major con is that the phone does not come with a charger inside the box, only a C to C type cable. I ordered a 20W boat charger which works perfectly but comes at an additional cost. The biggest con I see is the display, which is very bad in outdoor conditions even when set to full brightness. If you are an outdoor person, I would recommend avoiding this phone. The phone's appearance is very basic, and the back looks very plasticky (can be covered with a case). There is no punch hole camera.

Overall, if you are someone who makes long phone calls and wants a phone with good battery life and call quality, the Samsung M14 5G is a great choice.

Update 2: I came to know that 3rd camera which is a 2MP depth does nothing here, its better to go for F14 than this as you can save approx 1k instead of buying( may be you can buy a samsung 25 w fast charger with that money), all others specs are the same. The phone feels very heavy on hand mind it.",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTozMjM1NDkwMDYwMDg5NjkwOjE3MDA2Mzc3MzI6c3BfYXRmOjIwMTQ4MTQ3NDE3OTk4OjowOjo&url=%2FSamsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor%2Fdp%2FB0BZCR6TNK%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dmobile%26qid%3D1700637732%26sr%3D8-1-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1
Komal S.,Great for light users,Reviewed in India on 5 November 2023,"Bought it for my mother and it has got all the basics right. Battery life is excellent. I am charging it with my 20 watt moto charger, it takes 1.5 hrs to fully charge with it. Easily lasts for 2 to 2.5 days in light usage like calling, WhatsApp and YouTube. Software is amazing and smooth, no lags at all.

Cons:
- Don't expect much from camera. I will say camera quality is below average, but it still does the work. Front and back both.
- Screen is IPS LCD and not amoled, so you will always feel a difference because colors are not so punchy and because of that content watching experience is not that good.
- Speaker is just decent, not very loud.",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTozMjM1NDkwMDYwMDg5NjkwOjE3MDA2Mzc3MzI6c3BfYXRmOjIwMTQ4MTQ3NDE3OTk4OjowOjo&url=%2FSamsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor%2Fdp%2FB0BZCR6TNK%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dmobile%26qid%3D1700637732%26sr%3D8-1-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1
Mahendra N Raut,Far better in 10k compared to any other mobile in the world.,Reviewed in India on 1 November 2023,"I bought this just as 5G hotspot since in my village we do not have any wired connection possible at my place.
I have to find mobile network with 4G+/5G to work and place mobile for good connectivity and this is the best thing I found.
1. It has 5G bands needed on both Airtel/Jio
2. Carrier aggregation supported and thats great thing available in such low cost device.
3. I can use hotspot for full day without worrying about battery.
4. Screen is good compared to the price.
5. My Hotspot is able to store/transfer 105GB of data :D

Srinath,Samsung M14,Reviewed in India on 11 November 2023,The cable provided along with the box was a two end c-type connect which is a bad thing as we can charge the phone immediately after buying or may cause the damage of the battery buy using wrong adaptor.

Harsh Morasiya,Worth it,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2023,"So I am just waiting to write this review after few days of usage, and here Im writing it, after using it for 10 days. The phone is worth of the price I got it at ₹11500 in Amazon great Indian sale & this is 6gb-128gb varient. It doesn't have Amoled display but yes it does comes u with PLS IPS display. Also it has 90hz refresh rate
Things to keep in mind:-
1. It has a big battery setup of 6000mah so it take good amount to charge
2. It doesn't come with adaptor, no Mobile case, and cable is also type C to type c , so you cannot use it with your old USB cable. So either buy converter pin or buy original Samsung type c adaptor
3. It's camera is very good in night also
4. It's a decent phone which also look quite big but fit comfortably in hands.
Overall great experience in this 10days no heating issue nothing.
Also Samsung service is above all other phones.",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTozMjM1NDkwMDYwMDg5NjkwOjE3MDA2Mzc3MzI6c3BfYXRmOjIwMTQ4MTQ3NDE3OTk4OjowOjo&url=%2FSamsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor%2Fdp%2FB0BZCR6TNK%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dmobile%26qid%3D1700637732%26sr%3D8-1-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1

The camera is okay and takes reasonably good photos in daylight. Not great for night shots.

11. Finishing, glossy colour is minimalistic design
12. New One ui core is more feature rich and looks like full one ui
13. Security is my priyority to buy samsung mobile
Cons:
1. Device is bulky, large and heavy
2. Device become warm in normal use, that affect battery back up a little bit.
3. There is sudden play at back cover(Samsung need to strict its qc team)
4. Device stalls for a bit(2-4seconds, no touch response occurs then everything is ok)) during games and youtube(bug need to fix)
5. During games dont know why sound from the speaker distort and lags, but during youtube and other multimedia consumption sound is normal(I think bug need to fix)
6. During multimedia playback back cover potrion of speacker become warm
7. Also problem with proximity sensors. They wouldn't work properly on the 1st 2 call of day. Then they work properly

I dont know the problems are only in my unit or other users also facing same problem. When i bought this phone there was only option to return the device no replacement. I don't had spare phone. Thats why I had to keep the device. Amazon executive ran diagnosis test, no problem found. Went to cutomer service. There also no problem found. They updated software and that also can't solve the problems.",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo3MDE1NDgwNTI0ODY5MDoxNzAwNjQyNjA1OnNwX2F0ZjoyMDE0ODE0NzQxNzk5ODo6MDo6&url=%2FSamsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor%2Fdp%2FB0BZCR6TNK%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dmobile%26qid%3D1700642605%26sr%3D8-1-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1
Trusted reviews,A Solid Choice for Long Phone Calls and Battery Life,Reviewed in India on 16 October 2023,"Before settling on the Samsung M14 5G, I was considering three different models: the Redmi 12 5G, Moto G54 5G, and M14. Through my research, I found that the G54 had heating issues and the Redmi 12 had camera issues. As a general user who was looking for a good phone with good battery life and good call quality, I ultimately chose the M14.

In terms of network capabilities, this phone works best on 5G/4G and supports 13 bands on 5G, VOWIFI, and has 4G aggression which works seamlessly. The only feature missed was VONR. One feature that I found particularly useful is voice focus, which cuts background noise perfectly( particularly when you are train or noisy environment). The phone also has dedicated slots for SIM and SDCard.

Battery backup is amazing and can sustain for at least 2 days no matter how you use it. However, the camera is average and the rear camera is worse than the front camera. The Samsung UI is very good and supports dual apps (dual WhatsApp), and RAM management is good, though most of the time only 2GB of RAM is free. If you have a Samsung TV, this phone works flawlessly with it.

The phone comes with the latest Android 13 out of the box, and Samsung guarantees updates for OS and security updates which is a plus. The speaker is loud enough for calls and listening to YouTube videos. There are no bloatware apps, though there are a few that can be uninstalled.

One major con is that the phone does not come with a charger inside the box, only a C to C type cable. I ordered a 20W boat charger which works perfectly but comes at an additional cost. The biggest con I see is the display, which is very bad in outdoor conditions even when set to full brightness. If you are an outdoor person, I would recommend avoiding this phone. The phone's appearance is very basic, and the back looks very plasticky (can be covered with a case). There is no punch hole camera.

Overall, if you are someone who makes long phone calls and wants a phone with good battery life and call quality, the Samsung M14 5G is a great choice.

Update 2: I came to know that 3rd camera which is a 2MP depth does nothing here, its better to go for F14 than this as you can save approx 1k instead of buying( may be you can buy a samsung 25 w fast charger with that money), all others specs are the same. The phone feels very heavy on hand mind it.",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo3MDE1NDgwNTI0ODY5MDoxNzAwNjQyNjA1OnNwX2F0ZjoyMDE0ODE0NzQxNzk5ODo6MDo6&url=%2FSamsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor%2Fdp%2FB0BZCR6TNK%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dmobile%26qid%3D1700642605%26sr%3D8-1-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1
Komal S.,Great for light users,Reviewed in India on 5 November 2023,"Bought it for my mother and it has got all the basics right. Battery life is excellent. I am charging it with my 20 watt moto charger, it takes 1.5 hrs to fully charge with it. Easily lasts for 2 to 2.5 days in light usage like calling, WhatsApp and YouTube. Software is amazing and smooth, no lags at all.

Cons:
- Don't expect much from camera. I will say camera quality is below average, but it still does the work. Front and back both.
- Screen is IPS LCD and not amoled, so you will always feel a difference because colors are not so punchy and because of that content watching experience is not that good.
- Speaker is just decent, not very loud.",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo3MDE1NDgwNTI0ODY5MDoxNzAwNjQyNjA1OnNwX2F0ZjoyMDE0ODE0NzQxNzk5ODo6MDo6&url=%2FSamsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor%2Fdp%2FB0BZCR6TNK%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dmobile%26qid%3D1700642605%26sr%3D8-1-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1
Mahendra N Raut,Far better in 10k compared to any other mobile in the world.,Reviewed in India on 1 November 2023,"I bought this just as 5G hotspot since in my village we do not have any wired connection possible at my place.
I have to find mobile network with 4G+/5G to work and place mobile for good connectivity and this is the best thing I found.
1. It has 5G bands needed on both Airtel/Jio
2. Carrier aggregation supported and thats great thing available in such low cost device.
3. I can use hotspot for full day without worrying about battery.
4. Screen is good compared to the price.
5. My Hotspot is able to store/transfer 105GB of data :D
6. It does support installing android apps ;p

Harsh Morasiya,Worth it,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2023,"So I am just waiting to write this review after few days of usage, and here Im writing it, after using it for 10 days. The phone is worth of the price I got it at ₹11500 in Amazon great Indian sale & this is 6gb-128gb varient. It doesn't have Amoled display but yes it does comes u with PLS IPS display. Also it has 90hz refresh rate
Things to keep in mind:-
1. It has a big battery setup of 6000mah so it take good amount to charge
2. It doesn't come with adaptor, no Mobile case, and cable is also type C to type c , so you cannot use it with your old USB cable. So either buy converter pin or buy original Samsung type c adaptor
3. It's camera is very good in night also
4. It's a decent phone which also look quite big but fit comfortably in hands.
Overall great experience in this 10days no heating issue nothing.

K.Chandramouli,A well priced 5G phone,Reviewed in India on 8 November 2023,"It is a standard Samsung phone with lots of bloatware ,only some of which can be removed. The screen resolution is good for the price. The 6GB/128GB version is quite fast and wifi connectivity is good. The fingerprint sensor is very poor and takes several tries to work. The camera is okay and takes reasonably good photos in daylight. Not great for night shots. The battery lasts for over 1.5 days on a single charge with normal use of phone,video,music..etc. Overall it's a great buy at this price ,though hardcore gamers will have to look elsewhere for a suitable phone.",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo3MDE1NDgwNTI0ODY5MDoxNzAwNjQyNjA1OnNwX2F0ZjoyMDE0ODE0NzQxNzk5ODo6MDo6&url=%2FSamsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor%2Fdp%2FB0BZCR6TNK%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dmobile%26qid%3D1700642605%26sr%3D8-1-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1

1. Ram management is poor, phone doesn't keeps recent apps in background. Apps will restart. So it is recommended to buy 6gb varient instead of 4 gb.
2. Sometimes sound on this phone suddenly stops, it may be due to I got a defective unit or may be every phone has same issue. When I restart the phone or turn on silent/vibration mode and then switch to sound mode then phone volume comes back.
Rest everything is good according to the price.
1. Battery is super

Atul K.,camera quality is not good as expected.,Reviewed in India on 14 July 2023," Samsung Glaxy A30(2019) Camera quality is more better than Samsung Galaxy M14 5g because it's using only 12 mp only rear and front camera. 50 mp is only for 50 mp photoshoot mode other than useless.
nature photo is oversaturated but selfie is good . No clarity in zooming. Night mode is only for image not for Video recording.
camera is like 12k rs range phone. you got only brand name and processor. one ui is ok.

Overall camera spec -Rear 12 mp [1080p 30fps max rear and front.]
- Front 12 mp
You can record 4k video in open camera. and you can also record 1080p 60fps in open camera.
Main camera not support 4k video recording.

i have problem with my m14 device, "" when i insert a micro sd card then phone restarting again and again.i have samsung sd card 256 gb.
solution - when i inserted sd card in running phone then problem solve but after restarting the phone ,same problem created.

display have low saturation and very low brightness . not visible in sun light.
no any control for adjust saturation. my old nokia 3.1 plus display saturation is better than this 5g phone.
wifi and hotspot not working at same time and setting is removed that allow this feature.

Overall Good non chinese phone . you can also go for motog52 if you don't want 5g phone ,moto g52 is better for content watching.",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo3MDE1NDgwNTI0ODY5MDoxNzAwNjQyNjA1OnNwX2F0ZjoyMDE0ODE0NzQxNzk5ODo6MDo6&url=%2FSamsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor%2Fdp%2FB0BZCR6TNK%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dmobile%26qid%3D1700642605%26sr%3D8-1-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1

Mushtaq,Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features,Reviewed in India on 3 August 2023,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇

*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***

Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.

Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.

I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performance

Front and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.

Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.

Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.

Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.

Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.

Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.

Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.

Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.
Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.

Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.

I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.

Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.

As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.

If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.

But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.

In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.
I couldn't find a phone which has:

Super AmoLed Bright display.
6000 mAh battery.
OIS camera.
120hz Refresh Rate.
4 years of OS (stock Android like) updates
Decent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)
5G with several bands.

It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.

vm,Good Everyday Use Phone,Reviewed in India on 1 August 2023,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.

It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.

Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.

Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.

Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.

Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.

Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.

Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.

If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.

I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.

Overall a nice deal !",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo3MDE1NDgwNTI0ODY5MDoxNzAwNjQyNjA1OnNwX2F0ZjozMDAwMDk5OTIxNTYxMzI6OjA6Og&url=%2FSamsung-sAMOLED-Display-Battery-Security%2Fdp%2FB0C7C1DRK5%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dmobile%26qid%3D1700642605%26sr%3D8-2-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1
Biswajit Behera,Honest Review After 3 months of use,Reviewed in India on 31 July 2023,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.

( After 3 months am updating the review again below)

October Update: -
During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discount

My requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.

Cons or Disadvantages: -
1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)

2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.

3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic. Using Snapchat filter for good selfie
One more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.
Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile camera
Back camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there

4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available
5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .
After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds

6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respond

No more cons I found till date. I ll update later.

Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )

2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it

3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.

4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)
Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.

5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug in

Suggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.

If your priorities is display and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )

Sourya Gourab Nanda,Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.,Reviewed in India on 12 October 2023,"Hello!!
this is Sourya Gourab,
today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......
👉... PROS ...👈
▪️1) CAMERA:- the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍
▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔 honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.
▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍
▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.
👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/- is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍
▪️5) BATTERY🔋:- 6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.
But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc.....
❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️
▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!! KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇
SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....
I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️. Regards
Sourya Gourab Nanda

Namit Singh,Almost a 5 star review but somethings held me back,Reviewed in India on 16 November 2023,"The phone itself is amazing to touch and to feel.
The color midnight blue looks absolutely stunning. Very easy to setup and seamless data transferring from the old device.
The size of the phone is handy and not too big or small, I would the perfect size.
For the display all I need to say is that it is a Samsung display. Such a vibrant and good looking display, love it.
Didn't face any kind of lag or stuttering, the ram management is also pretty good.
The cameras too are pretty decent, daylight photography would yield good photos and in night the quality would go down but still so much better than other phones in this segment. Loved the cameras too 💥
The updates too are amazing, 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of security updates.
Speakers are loud too, with a decent amount of bass and clarity.
5g works well if you live in a metropolitan area, where 5g is available throughout.
The phone feels sturdy and durable.

Now why not 5 stars...
1) the phone gets hot, use too much camera the phone will get hot, use the phone for a really long time 3-4 hours it will get hot even in the winters.
2) the design is not the latest but will suffice. Still Samsung should have given a punch hole display.",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo3MDE1NDgwNTI0ODY5MDoxNzAwNjQyNjA1OnNwX2F0ZjozMDAwMDk5OTIxNTYxMzI6OjA6Og&url=%2FSamsung-sAMOLED-Display-Battery-Security%2Fdp%2FB0C7C1DRK5%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dmobile%26qid%3D1700642605%26sr%3D8-2-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1
Sameep Girdher,Good Smartphone for Multitasking but it can freeze a bit if you put high load by opening many apps .,Reviewed in India on 13 November 2023,"I like it for day to day life as i'm not a gamer

Pros-
1.Its good for people with concern of battery backup as it has 1.5 to 2 day backup.

2.You should prefer 8gb 128gb minimum variant as there will be 4 OS updates and to handle that 8gb minimum ram should be required.

3.Also, camera quality is good and on top of that 120 hz Amoled Full Hd+ display is top notch.

Cons-
1. Not suitable for high end gaming , you can play games but not at highest graphics , standard graphics is preferred.

2.Some time get overheated due to excessive gaming or playing at high resoluion.

3. Fingerprint sensor is not that fast but decent.",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo3MDE1NDgwNTI0ODY5MDoxNzAwNjQyNjA1OnNwX2F0ZjozMDAwMDk5OTIxNTYxMzI6OjA6Og&url=%2FSamsung-sAMOLED-Display-Battery-Security%2Fdp%2FB0C7C1DRK5%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dmobile%26qid%3D1700642605%26sr%3D8-2-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1
Kindle Customer,One of the best phones in mid range price band,Reviewed in India on 5 November 2023,"Samsung is one of my favorite brands in Android smartphone segment, I have used C9, J7 prime, A50, A80, S21. Have also purchased A7 & A10 for a family member. I was looking to buy a mid range phone and this is one of the best phones in mid range prices with 4 Android and 5 yrs security updates. Samsung is known for a good display and awesome cameras however this device scores low as per my expectations. Another plus is powerful battery which lasts for more than a day if the usage is normal. One of the BIGGEST drawback, it's heavy and thicker as compared to the current generation of smartphones and may discourage buyers. So if you are looking for lighter and thinner phones, this may not be the right phone for you.",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo3MDE1NDgwNTI0ODY5MDoxNzAwNjQyNjA1OnNwX2F0ZjozMDAwMDk5OTIxNTYxMzI6OjA6Og&url=%2FSamsung-sAMOLED-Display-Battery-Security%2Fdp%2FB0C7C1DRK5%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dmobile%26qid%3D1700642605%26sr%3D8-2-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1
Vijay Kumar,Is it worth?,Reviewed in India on 17 November 2023,"Phone looks premium. Size feels big but it is normal these days all smartphone have almost same size. Touce responce is good 120hz feel super smooth don't swith to 60hz it kills the smoothness. I don't know about Durabitity , samsung promise for 4yrs os update but i don't think it can handle it.

swati,Overrated and overpriced,Reviewed in India on 16 November 2023,"Pros :
1.Battery life is good. Easily works whole day with high usage.
2.Security and updates are good
3.Audio quality is good .

Cons:
1. Very heavy in weight
2. Very bad ,literally pathetic selfie ( front) camera
3.If you have used xiomi, redmi or oppo or any other phones in the past ,you will miss their camera and video quality. Very bad video quality.
4.Hear echo on calls most of the times.
6. No charger and dont get good back covers for this phone in market.

Sarvesh K.,Nice camera and battery,Reviewed in India on 19 November 2023,"1. OIS Camera is better than other phones at this price. But not good as s21 fe and apple 7 plus. Broken Pixels are seen on zoom in pics. Video recording is good one.
2. 6000mah battery is best if you disable 5g connectivity. M34 uses 5nm processor which consumes less battery. Charging takes around 2 hours 20 minutes.
3. Worth at 15k price.

Harish R.,All rounder,Reviewed in India on 30 October 2023,"What do you want in a phone?
1. Battery? Yes. 6000 mah. Will comfortably work for 36+ hrs. SOT(about 10 hrs). It has Battery protect feature. More than enough.
2. Display? 120 hz super amoled. More than enough.
3. Software? One UI 5.1 flagship level. All features and customization available. With good lock you get everything. Android 13 out of the box.
4. Updates? 4 years OS + 5 years security. More than enough
5. Knox security.
6. Samsung wallet with nfc.
7. Simple. Durable.
8. If you compare with other Chinese phones, goes are assembled phone. But Samsung has its own chipset(not the best one), camera sensors(good), display(very good) hence these very well co-ordinated.
9. I almost forgot, camera is good.
10. Phone is not for pro gamers.
11. No heating.",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo3MDE1NDgwNTI0ODY5MDoxNzAwNjQyNjA1OnNwX2F0ZjozMDAwMDk5OTIxNTYxMzI6OjA6Og&url=%2FSamsung-sAMOLED-Display-Battery-Security%2Fdp%2FB0C7C1DRK5%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dmobile%26qid%3D1700642605%26sr%3D8-2-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1
Shibhu,Good phone as it is samsung.,Reviewed in India on 18 November 2023,Phone is good. But has a lagging problem. A bit slow. Overall 👍 👌. But after using one plus ull fell the samsung is slow.

Pulkit,Buy only for your dad or mom,Reviewed in India on 9 October 2023,"All YouTube reviews are fake. They all get paid for it

Pros

Let's First talk about camera and screen the main highlights of screen
They all appreciated camera alot but it's not even close to hype gives yellowish tone to each photo like a cheap smartphone not eyepleasing at all
Display is good acc to price but you can tell the difference only when put side to side with another smartphone otherwise all display gives similar view in this price range
So not worth buying only for display

Now price i bought it for 15000
So I should be comparing it with other 15000rs smartphones but not you should go for Smartphone around 17000 because 15000₹ for smartphone + 1500 for charger + 200 cover and screen guard= 16700 ( other brands give all this with smartphone)

So all the best things about this phone camera display price , in actual are not that good all this is gimmick so only buy this phone for your parents who doesn't have long screentime as it has big battery, 4 years of updates

Cons
Took 2 hours too charge that's is way too long
Processor is not that good as you already know
Not worth the price there are better option in less price
Ugly drop notch chin ( though Mobile looks good you may call somewhat premium if chin is ignored)

If you are getting this with charger under 15k and not that fond of gaming and whitish photos ( pictures that makes you look fair) then you can go for it",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo3MDE1NDgwNTI0ODY5MDoxNzAwNjQyNjA1OnNwX2F0ZjozMDAwMDk5OTIxNTYxMzI6OjA6Og&url=%2FSamsung-sAMOLED-Display-Battery-Security%2Fdp%2FB0C7C1DRK5%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dmobile%26qid%3D1700642605%26sr%3D8-2-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1

Phone seems to stutter rarely not so frequent can be ignored. If you set your expectations in check then this won't disappoint you.

Don't buy if you are gamer, 4k Video watcher on youtube.
But if you are scroller of instagram, facebook and lite gaming.

Camera is good
Not best
Inflation affects a lot.
So, Buy only 8GB+256GB variant because hybrid simslot and no esim support buy 8GB+256GB which only make sense.
Samsung please give us charger also
1k for charger it's a huge price.

Connectivity- 5G is stable I tested with Airtel 5g and speed is awesome.

Heating- No heating issue

Performence- Phone performs smoothly in all apps. Sometimes jitters at the time of heavy multitasking. This phone is not for high end gaming

Camera- The best camera under 20k

Battery - Battery is 6000 mah but it feels like 5000, It's okay normal.

Display- No comparison in display, it's awesome

One ui- The full one ui is so much usefully in daily office tasks. It packs uncountable features for you.

Mattjo,Negative Review: Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green,Reviewed in India on 31 July 2023,"The Samsung Galaxy M04 in Light Green may be budget-friendly, but it falls disappointingly short when it comes to camera performance. If you're someone who enjoys capturing life's moments with stunning clarity, this phone is bound to leave you feeling frustrated.

Camera Performance:
The 13MP primary camera on the Galaxy M04 struggles to produce satisfactory results, especially in anything less than optimal lighting conditions. Photos taken indoors or in low-light environments suffer from excessive noise and lack of detail. Even in well-lit settings, the colors appear muted, and the dynamic range is limited. The 5MP front camera is equally lackluster, producing selfies that lack sharpness and clarity. If you're a photography enthusiast, this phone simply won't meet your expectations.

Gaming Performance:
While the Galaxy M04 manages day-to-day tasks adequately, it's not designed for high-performance gaming. Graphically demanding games often suffer from lag and frame rate drops, making the gaming experience less enjoyable. If you're into heavy mobile gaming, you'd be better off considering a more powerful device.

Battery Life:
Although the 5,000mAh battery is impressive on paper, the subpar gaming performance drains the battery quickly during extended gaming sessions. While the phone may suffice for parents who use it for occasional tasks, the battery life may not last a full day under heavy usage scenarios.

Display:
The 6.3-inch HD+ LCD display is mediocre at best. While it gets the job done for casual media consumption, the lack of vibrant colors and average viewing angles fail to impress. The visual experience simply doesn't match up to other smartphones in this price range.

Software and Updates:
Samsung's One UI skin is generally user-friendly, but the budget nature of this phone means that major updates and feature enhancements might not be promptly delivered. This could lead to missing out on essential improvements and security patches.

Conclusion:
If you're a photography enthusiast or a heavy mobile gamer, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green will be a major disappointment. The lackluster camera performance, subpar gaming capabilities, and average display make it unsuitable for users who prioritize these aspects. However, if you're a parent or a casual user who primarily needs a phone for basic tasks like calls, messaging, and light browsing, the Galaxy M04 might suffice. For anything more demanding, there are better options available in the market at a similar price point.

Pros:

Suitable for parents or casual users with basic needs
Affordable price point
Cons:

Subpar camera performance in various lighting conditions
Not suitable for high-performance gaming
Mediocre display quality
Potential delays in major software updates

Positives
1. Price point with reputed brand support

Negatives
1. No fingerprint scanner
2. No support for 5GHz WiFi
3. ""Always On Display"" setting is missing
4. Face recognition feature only works intermittently, possibly due to lower resolution of front facing camera
5. Battery barely lasts one day with moderate usage. Doesn't support fast charging even with manufacturer provided charger and cable",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Storage-MediaTek-Octa-core-Processor/dp/B0BMGB2TPR/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-3

Vishnu,Awesome,Reviewed in India on 17 August 2023,"The Samsung M04 offers a budget-friendly option with a 6.2-inch display, providing a decent viewing experience for its price point. Its performance is satisfactory for everyday tasks thanks to the Snapdragon processor and 3GB of RAM, though demanding apps or games might not run as smoothly.

The camera setup, featuring a dual-lens rear camera with a 13MP main sensor and a 2MP depth sensor, captures acceptable photos in well-lit conditions, but struggles in low light. The front-facing 5MP camera is suitable for basic selfies and video calls.

The device houses a 5,000mAh battery, which can easily last through a day of regular usage. However, charging is done through a micro-USB port, which might be a bit outdated for some users.

On the software side, the M04 runs Samsung's One UI on top of Android, providing a user-friendly experience and some customization options. As for storage, the 32GB internal storage can be expanded via microSD card for those who need more space.

In summary, the Samsung M04 is a decent budget smartphone that gets the basics done, but it's important to manage expectations given its limitations in terms of performance and camera quality, which are common trade-offs in this price range.",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Storage-MediaTek-Octa-core-Processor/dp/B0BMGB2TPR/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-3

Mattjo,Negative Review: Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green,Reviewed in India on 31 July 2023,"The Samsung Galaxy M04 in Light Green may be budget-friendly, but it falls disappointingly short when it comes to camera performance. If you're someone who enjoys capturing life's moments with stunning clarity, this phone is bound to leave you feeling frustrated.

Camera Performance:
The 13MP primary camera on the Galaxy M04 struggles to produce satisfactory results, especially in anything less than optimal lighting conditions. Photos taken indoors or in low-light environments suffer from excessive noise and lack of detail. Even in well-lit settings, the colors appear muted, and the dynamic range is limited. The 5MP front camera is equally lackluster, producing selfies that lack sharpness and clarity. If you're a photography enthusiast, this phone simply won't meet your expectations.

Gaming Performance:
While the Galaxy M04 manages day-to-day tasks adequately, it's not designed for high-performance gaming. Graphically demanding games often suffer from lag and frame rate drops, making the gaming experience less enjoyable. If you're into heavy mobile gaming, you'd be better off considering a more powerful device.

Battery Life:
Although the 5,000mAh battery is impressive on paper, the subpar gaming performance drains the battery quickly during extended gaming sessions. While the phone may suffice for parents who use it for occasional tasks, the battery life may not last a full day under heavy usage scenarios.

Display:
The 6.3-inch HD+ LCD display is mediocre at best. While it gets the job done for casual media consumption, the lack of vibrant colors and average viewing angles fail to impress. The visual experience simply doesn't match up to other smartphones in this price range.

Software and Updates:
Samsung's One UI skin is generally user-friendly, but the budget nature of this phone means that major updates and feature enhancements might not be promptly delivered. This could lead to missing out on essential improvements and security patches.

Conclusion:
If you're a photography enthusiast or a heavy mobile gamer, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green will be a major disappointment. The lackluster camera performance, subpar gaming capabilities, and average display make it unsuitable for users who prioritize these aspects. However, if you're a parent or a casual user who primarily needs a phone for basic tasks like calls, messaging, and light browsing, the Galaxy M04 might suffice. For anything more demanding, there are better options available in the market at a similar price point.

Pros:

Suitable for parents or casual users with basic needs
Affordable price point
Cons:

Subpar camera performance in various lighting conditions
Not suitable for high-performance gaming
Mediocre display quality
Potential delays in major software updates

Amazon Customer,Strictly starter phone if OK with compromises,Reviewed in India on 12 November 2023,"Has decent specifications for a starter phone but has serious drawbacks due to lack certain basic features that cripple the phone.

Positives
1. Price point with reputed brand support

Negatives
1. No fingerprint scanner
2. No support for 5GHz WiFi
3. ""Always On Display"" setting is missing
4. Face recognition feature only works intermittently, possibly due to lower resolution of front facing camera
5. Battery barely lasts one day with moderate usage. Doesn't support fast charging even with manufacturer provided charger and cable",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Storage-MediaTek-Octa-core-Processor/dp/B0BMGB3CH9/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-4

Kushal,Suspicious packaging,Reviewed in India on 28 October 2023,The phone works perfectly for this price range and the design is also premium. The only problem was the package was suspicious.

Vishnu,Awesome,Reviewed in India on 17 August 2023,"The Samsung M04 offers a budget-friendly option with a 6.2-inch display, providing a decent viewing experience for its price point. Its performance is satisfactory for everyday tasks thanks to the Snapdragon processor and 3GB of RAM, though demanding apps or games might not run as smoothly.

The camera setup, featuring a dual-lens rear camera with a 13MP main sensor and a 2MP depth sensor, captures acceptable photos in well-lit conditions, but struggles in low light. The front-facing 5MP camera is suitable for basic selfies and video calls.

The device houses a 5,000mAh battery, which can easily last through a day of regular usage. However, charging is done through a micro-USB port, which might be a bit outdated for some users.

On the software side, the M04 runs Samsung's One UI on top of Android, providing a user-friendly experience and some customization options. As for storage, the 32GB internal storage can be expanded via microSD card for those who need more space.

In summary, the Samsung M04 is a decent budget smartphone that gets the basics done, but it's important to manage expectations given its limitations in terms of performance and camera quality, which are common trade-offs in this price range.",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Storage-MediaTek-Octa-core-Processor/dp/B0BMGB3CH9/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-4

Neeraj Yadav,realme Narzo 60X 5G,Reviewed in India on 11 October 2023,"realme Narzo 60 5G आखिरकार आ चुका है। अगर आप भी इस फोन को खरीदने के बारे में सोच रहे थे तो हम कुछ चीजों के बारे में बताने जा रहे हैं। इसकी मदद से आप इस फोन को काफी आसानी से बंपर डिस्काउंट के साथ ऑर्डर कर सकते हैं। यही वजह है कि इसे ऑर्डर करने से पहले आपको डिजाइन, डिस्प्ले, परफॉर्मेंस और कैमरे के बारे में जरूर जान लेना चाहिए
इसके पप्राइमरी कैमरा से तस्वीरें अच्छी आती हैं, लेकिन ये रंगों को थोड़ा बूस्ट कर देता है। हालांकि डिटेल अच्छी मिलती है। हमने इसे बहुत ज़्यादा टेस्ट नहीं किया है, लेकिन आप कुछ कैमरा सैंपल नीचे देख सकते हैं।मैंने इसे कुछ ही समय इस्तेमाल किया है, जिसमें कई ऐप्स एक साथ चलायीं, कॉलिंग भी की और इस दौरान मुझे कोई लैग नहीं दिखा।
सॉफ्टवेयर साइड पर, Narzo 60x में Android 13 आधारित realmeUI 4.0 है। फ़ोन में कई ऐप्स पहले से मौजूद हैं, जैसे FinShell Pay, Paytm, Linkedin, Candy Crush, Josh, Netflix, Royal Match Game, इत्यादि।
Realme के इस नए बजट फ़ोन में भी 5,000 mAh की ही बैटरी है और फ़ोन के साथ आपको चार्जिंग केबल और 33W का अडैप्टर मिलता है। इस चार्जर के साथ फ़ोन को 0 से 100% तक चार्ज होने में लगभग 75-80 मिनट का समय लगता है। मेरे इस्तेमाल के दौरान में थोड़ी कंटेंट स्ट्रीमिंग की और बाकी कॉलिंग व कुछ ऐप्स का इस्तेमाल, तो मुझे इसे दिन भर में चार्ज करने की ज़रुरत नहीं पड़ी। फ़ोन में Power Saving Mode है, जिसके साथ ये आपको लगभग 2 दिन का बैटरी बैकअप दे सकता है।
Realme Narzo 60x की कीमत 12,999 रुपए से शुरू होती है। इस कीमत पर ये आपको एक अच्छा डिज़ाइन ऑफर करता है, ख़ासतौर से युवाओं के लिए। फ़ोन देखने में सस्तेपन का अनुभव नहीं देता। डिस्प्ले और परफॉरमेंस भी रोज़मर्रा के अनुसार संतोषजनक है। इसके अलावा इस बजट में इसकी रियर कैमरा परफॉरमेंस भी अच्छी है, हालांकि सेल्फी कैमरा हमने अभी टेस्ट नहीं किया है, इसके लिए आपको हमारे रिव्यु का इंतज़ार करना होगा।
फ़ोन में दो वैरिएंट उपलब्ध हैं और 120Hz डिस्प्ले, 50MP प्राइमरी कैमरा, 33w फ़ास्ट चार्जिंग सपोर्ट जैसे स्पेसिफिकेशन भी हैं, जो अपनी कीमत के अनुसार आपको निराश नहीं करते हैं।
Realme Narzo 60x 5G में ओक्टा कोर Dimensity 6100+ 6nm चिपसेट है। साथ में 6GB तक की LPDDR4x रैम और 128GB की UFS 2.2 स्टोरेज है। स्टोरेज आपको थोड़ी कम लग सकती है, लेकिन ऐसे में फ़ोन में मौजूद माइक्रो एसडी स्लॉट के साथ आप इसे 2TB तक बढ़ा सकते हैं। ये वही चिपसेट है, जिसके साथ पिछले महीने Realme 11x 5G को लॉन्च किया गया है। ये प्रोसेसर रोज़मर्रा के कामों को आसानी से कर लेता है। गेमिंग मैंने बहुत ज़्यादा टेस्ट नहीं की, लेकिन इस चिपसेट के साथ आप CoD और PUBG जैसे खेल भी खेल सकते हैं, लेकिन मीडियम ग्राफ़िक्स और फ्रेम रेट पर।
Realme Narzo 60x 5G में 6.72-इंच की फुल एचडी+ डिस्प्ले है। इसमें 120Hz तक की डायनामिक रिफ्रेश रेट सपोर्ट और 680 निट्स तक की पीक ब्राइटनेस मिलेगी। फ़ोन बाहर की रौशनी में रिफ्लेक्टिव है, लेकिन इस्तेमाल किया जा सकता है। स्क्रीन में भले ही 120Hz रिफ्रेश रेट सपोर्ट के साथ स्मूथ अनुभव मिलता है, लेकिन इसकी तुलना आप फ्लैगशिप फोनों से नहीं कर सकते और कीमतों के अनुसार न ही करनी चाहिए।
स्क्रीन पर हल्का ब्लू टिंट नज़र आता है, लेकिन डिस्प्ले सेटिंग्स में Screen Colour mode ऑप्शन में जाकर आप इसे Natural पर सेट करें और स्लाइडर को थोड़ा Warm साइड पर रखें, तो ये थोड़ा बेहतर हो जाता है। कुल मिलाकर इसका डिस्प्ले रोज़ के कामों के दौरान मुझे ठीक लगा।
इसमें दायीं साइड पर वॉल्यूम बटन और पावर बटन हैं और बायीं तरफ आप सिम लगा सकते हैं। निचली एज पर आपको ऑडियो जैक, माइक्रोफोन, स्पीकर और टाइप-सी पोर्ट मिलेंगे। कीमतों को देखते हुए मुझे इस फ़ोन के डिज़ाइन से कोई शिकायत नहीं है, लेकिन कवर पहले आये पारदर्शी कवरों जैसा होता, तभी बेहतर होता। Realme Narzo 60x 5G प्लास्टिक बॉडी के साथ आता है, लेकिन देखने में ये ग्लास रियर पैनल लगता है। फ़ोन पर एक बड़ा गोल कैमरा मॉड्यूल है और बाकी रियर पैनल पर आपको एक टेक्सचर नज़र आएगा। हमें ये फ़ोन हरे (Stellar Green) रंग में मिला है और इसके रियर पैनल पर जो पैटर्न या टेक्सचर है, उसे कंपनी ने InterstellarX का नाम दिया है। फ़ोन में साइड का फ्रेम भी मेटल से बना लगता है, लेकिन ये भी प्लास्टिक ही है। देखने में ये आपको आकर्षक लग सकता है, लेकिन तभी जब आपको कोई चमकता रंग पसंद हो। हालांकि सादे रंग पसंद करने वालों के लिए ये काले रंग में भी उपलब्ध है।

फ़ोन का डिज़ाइन अच्छा है, लेकिन ये पतला नहीं है। इसकी मोटाई 7.89mm है और साथ ही फ्लैट डिज़ाइन होने के कारण ये हाथ में उतना आरामदायक नहीं है, लेकिन ये समस्या आपको फ़ोन के साथ आने वाले कवर से नहीं आएगी। लेकिन इस बार कंपनी ने फ़ोन के साथ काले शेड का कवर दिया है, जिससे फ़ोन का डिज़ाइन उतना आकर्षक नहीं रह जाता। अभी तक सभी फोनों में पारदर्शी TPU कवर ही आये हैं, इसीलिए ये थोड़ा अजीब तो है।",https://www.amazon.in/realme-5G%EF%BC%88Nebula-External-Segments-Supervooc/dp/B0CGDNJX9X/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-5
Parth,It cost me 11500(in Amazon great indian festival deal),Reviewed in India on 21 October 2023,"Camera : camera is decent.. it's average, sometimes it takes awesome pictures and sometimes don't. Not good in low light... And also boost the colors and can't catch (or idk if it's hiding) details... Like my one of friend had worn lakhnvi kurta, and after taking the pic that maroon color kurta it was looking like red color kurta and not lakhvnvi but plain kurta...😅 I've uploaded images for that... First image of kurta was taken by iphone and look at there and the second one was taken by this narzo 60x...you can see the difference... So if your priority is not camera or you are satisfied with above images you must go for it...

Sound quality: it's normal... And mostly i use wireless neckband or tws so it fine for me.....

Battery : battery backup is good, since it has big display it will use more battery, but if you use with low brightness then it gives amazing backup...

Also you should keep turning off background processes by going into setting and search process manager and end the process which you won't like to run in background and also you can freez app so they won't be used in background... As an example i use insta for watching reels only so I have freezed the app and so it won't run in background but as i open it will work normal..
This things can save much much ram and also battery...

Ease of use: ui is good, all features are available like ,
internet speed,
daily data usage,
One handed mode,
Bottom slide finger to change recent app,
Screen off gestures -> double tap turn on off, draw on lock sceeen and open some app..
Youtube background play
Etc....

Performance : it is good for regular usage, I didn't feel any leg while using the mohile, and since I don't play games, I can't say about mobile while playing games...it doesn't get heat while watching youtube and Instagram...
App opening and closing is fast...

Ram management: Ram management is good but i can't understand that virtual ram(z-ram what they called).. I didn't find any usecase of it until now...
Display: display attracted me a lot, i mean colors are too good....and I also have used it in sunlight, everything was visible properly

I also checked antutu score by myself in this device

The device has setting about refresh rate and perfomance mode

So,

with 60hz refresh rate and balance mode i got antutu score of 4,10,000

With 120hz and high perfomance mode I got 4,20,000

Note: antutu score may very depending upon any background porcess runnig or not, bluetooth wifi is on or off....and also near by temperature affect it

So try using close all the apps and also if try it with in appropriate temperature and also don't put your mobile in charging...I don't know above things will affect antutu score or not but still to be on safe side this things are necessary..",https://www.amazon.in/realme-5G%EF%BC%88Nebula-External-Segments-Supervooc/dp/B0CGDNJX9X/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-5

Realme Narzo 60X 5G quick review: Looks good but sounds familiar
Highlights
Realme Narzo 60X 5G arrived in India today.
Realme Narzo 60X 5G starts at Rs 12,999 in India.
Realme Narzo 60X 5G will go on sale in India on September 12.
Realme Narzo 60X 5G quick review: Realme launched a new mid-budget smartphone, dubbed as the Realme Narzo 60X 5G in India today. The newly launched Realme Narzo 60X 5G is a part of the company's Narzo 60 series devices, which also includes the Realme Narzo 60 5G and the Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G smartphones. Despite being a sibling of the Narzo 60 Series, the phone seems a closer cousin of the Realme 11X 5G smartphone that was launched in India last month. Interestingly, this familiarity is not just in terms of the design but also in terms of the features.

Srajan,Amazing picture quality and Ultra Fast Charging,Reviewed in India on 8 November 2023,"This is a very good phone with all features needed for the new generation.
Some key features are:-
Good battery backup- 1 day backup after full charge on using it for about 8 hrs per day
33W supervooc charger is the best that can charge the phone from less than 10 % to 100% in 1hr.
amazing display with super smooth 120Hz rate.
Cons- I am using it for a month and I have not found any thing bad about this phone except that the realme UI features are less as compared to other brand like Redmi and Samsung.
Furthermore it does not support NFC payments.

Summary - The phone is best for a College guy for multitasking and daily use for creating assignments, reading notes and creating ppts, etc.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-5G%EF%BC%88Nebula-External-Segments-Supervooc/dp/B0CGDNJX9X/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-5

Vishu,Honest review,Reviewed in India on 14 October 2023,"I have been using Realme Narzo 60x 5g for quite sometime so here is my review of this device.

Pros:
1. Smooth experience - This device has 120hz display, therefore it's provides smooth scrolling experience if set at 120hz.

2. Battery life - This device has good battery life once charged upto 80 percent it can last full day on normal use.

3. Fast charging - This device comes with 33 watt fast charger which can charge the 5000 mah battery of this device upto 80 percent in 1 and half hour.

Cons : 1. Sound quality - The Microphone sound volume and quality is low, this phone is not for those who use phone primarily for calling as it's sound volume is low so what other person is talking may not be audible sometimes.

2. Music sound quality is low - This is not for those who love listening music at high volume since the sound volume is low. The loudspeaker is a single speaker not dual. speaker's sound volume is not that high

3. Dull display - This device's has a big display but the display is slight yellow in colour. At first I thought night mode or eye protection is on so I checked it and it was not on. So the display is itself slight yellow in colour which can affect multimedia experience. You may not like watching YouTube videos from this device as the video appears yellowish.
Update:- After software updates the yellowness has reduced.

3. Camera -

Prabeez,Narzo 60x ❤️👌,Reviewed in India on 16 October 2023,"Narzo 60x.. Such a wonderful phone at this price range.. Same as of 11x by realme.. Only camera is 50mp but more excellent than 11x as its a new camera rather than the old 64 mp one in 11x,some samples adding..
I got it for 11250 the 6/128 version and also exchange value of 2500 for my 3.5 old infinix hot 8..so was a very good deal for the shoping festival days... Now the price is 14999..
Camera is excellent but lacking image stability durinh video recording.. Also 4k not available.g Battery backup 5000mah is deceny, havent tried any games yt, but the antutu score is nearby 4.2 lakhs.. So definitely will give a medium experience👌.. Also about the display very good with 700nits and rolls out with latest Android 13 with realme UI 4 with 2years update and 3years security updates.. So you will get android 14 nd 15..thats a good thing😍..
If your getting the phone below 12500 thats a very good deal whereas the same one with number series thats 11x is just 1000rs extra for the same variants with same specs and features..
Go for it.. Its good",https://www.amazon.in/realme-5G%EF%BC%88Nebula-External-Segments-Supervooc/dp/B0CGDNJX9X/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-5
Chitradeep Das,Worthy Deal!,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2023,"The Realme Narzo 60x 5G is a worthy device in this price range. Here is my detailed review:

1. Looks & build quality is great, its thin and classy with an impressive texture at the back.
2. Performance is average, ram management is not that good but its enough for daily use. The chipset performs well and doesn't heat.
3. Battery will last for a day with moderate uses.
4. 120hz is cool but sometimes i feel few frame drops but that lasts for a few milliseconds.
5. Camera's output is good in this range as it has an AI camera. The edge detection is great with good skin output.
6. Now the 5G part! Well its pretty good since it has 9 bands of 5G.

Only the thing I am not happy for is the UI & OS, it has many bloatwares and the phone is filled with hotapps which you can't remove. Unnecessary features loaded mades it more annoying.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-5G%EF%BC%88Nebula-External-Segments-Supervooc/dp/B0CGDNJX9X/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-5

Ankush Kumar,Basic features are missing...,Reviewed in India on 28 May 2023,"There is no option to Hide Apps. No App Lock or any such option to hide the many apps which you may not use. The UI version is T edition and that is not even mentioned on the website. The previous UI versions and the option to enable Hide Apps or Lock Apps is listed on Realme website. I use the feature of Hide Apps on all my phones and so it was a disappointment here. Call to customer care did not get a confirmation if that will be available in future updates.
- There is no option to private storagefor photo and videos. In all my other phones I have this option and even on the cheaper that Realme ones. Again a disappointment for me and as before no confirmation from customer care about future update.
- Call recording options- In what seems to be a bizzare setting, the recording is split into two - one to record all calls from numbers not in your contact list and the other for Selected numbers which would require you to start adding all your contacts one by one painfully. There is no simple option to record all calls. For someone with maybe 200 or more contacts it is a hard day's work. You have to click Choose contact and from the next screen of all listed contacts, select a contact which takes you back to the previous screen. You have to again click Choose contact to select your next contact. Very tiring and cumbersome and I am not sure why Realme had to complicate this simple option into something so confounding. Real disappointment for me there.

Keeping these three issues aside, I loved this phone every bit.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-Feather-Segment-Charging-Slimmest/dp/B0C45VWDWJ/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-6
Rohan Kumar Mishra,Honest review and pros and cons,Reviewed in India on 29 July 2023,"Here is my honest review of the realme narzo N53 smartphone:

Pros:

Fast charging - The 33W fast charging allows the phone's 5,000 mAh battery to charge very quickly. realme claims it can charge to 50% in just 28 minutes.
Slim design - At 7.99mm thick, realme says this is the slimmest phone in its price segment. The featherweight design makes it comfortable to hold.
90Hz display - The 6.6"" FHD+ display has a 90Hz refresh rate for smooth scrolling and transitions. Good for gaming and multimedia.
Decent hardware - It has a MediaTek Helio G85 processor, up to 6GB RAM and 128GB storage which is decent hardware for the price. Gaming performance should be smooth.
Cons:

Average camera - The 50MP main camera is decent but night photography and low light shots may not be great. Lacks high-end camera features like OIS.
Older software - Ships with Android 11, not the latest Android 12. Support for software updates is unclear.
Plastic build - The featherlight design is thanks to a plastic body rather than glass or metal. It doesn't feel very premium.
Overall, the narzo N53 offers good fast charging, a slim and light design, smooth 90Hz display and decent performance for the price. But the cameras, software and build quality could be better. For budget smartphone buyers who prioritize fast charging and design, it's worth considering. But those wanting the best camera or software may want to look at other options.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-Feather-Segment-Charging-Slimmest/dp/B0C45VWDWJ/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-6

Souvik S.,That was not expected from Samsung,Reviewed in India on 6 September 2023,"Pros:
1. Display(although tft but can beat any good quality ips)
2. Camera(eis)(I didn't expected that camera from that phone)
3. Battery
4. 25watt chargin support
5. Software update
6. Tripple slot
7. Headphone jack
8. All Indian 5g bands supported
9. Durable
10. Easy to hold and comfortable in hand
11. Finishing, glossy colour is minimalistic design
12. New One ui core is more feature rich and looks like full one ui
13. Security is my priyority to buy samsung mobile
Cons:
1. Device is bulky, large and heavy
2. Device become warm in normal use, that affect battery back up a little bit.
3. There is sudden play at back cover(Samsung need to strict its qc team)
4. Device stalls for a bit(2-4seconds, no touch response occurs then everything is ok)) during games and youtube(bug need to fix)
5. During games dont know why sound from the speaker distort and lags, but during youtube and other multimedia consumption sound is normal(I think bug need to fix)
6. During multimedia playback back cover potrion of speacker become warm
7. Also problem with proximity sensors. They wouldn't work properly on the 1st 2 call of day. Then they work properly

I dont know the problems are only in my unit or other users also facing same problem. When i bought this phone there was only option to return the device no replacement. I don't had spare phone. Thats why I had to keep the device. Amazon executive ran diagnosis test, no problem found. Went to cutomer service. There also no problem found. They updated software and that also can't solve the problems.",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor/dp/B0BZCSNTT4/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-7
Trusted reviews,A Solid Choice for Long Phone Calls and Battery Life,Reviewed in India on 16 October 2023,"Before settling on the Samsung M14 5G, I was considering three different models: the Redmi 12 5G, Moto G54 5G, and M14. Through my research, I found that the G54 had heating issues and the Redmi 12 had camera issues. As a general user who was looking for a good phone with good battery life and good call quality, I ultimately chose the M14.

In terms of network capabilities, this phone works best on 5G/4G and supports 13 bands on 5G, VOWIFI, and has 4G aggression which works seamlessly. The only feature missed was VONR. One feature that I found particularly useful is voice focus, which cuts background noise perfectly( particularly when you are train or noisy environment). The phone also has dedicated slots for SIM and SDCard.

Battery backup is amazing and can sustain for at least 2 days no matter how you use it. However, the camera is average and the rear camera is worse than the front camera. The Samsung UI is very good and supports dual apps (dual WhatsApp), and RAM management is good, though most of the time only 2GB of RAM is free. If you have a Samsung TV, this phone works flawlessly with it.

The phone comes with the latest Android 13 out of the box, and Samsung guarantees updates for OS and security updates which is a plus. The speaker is loud enough for calls and listening to YouTube videos. There are no bloatware apps, though there are a few that can be uninstalled.

One major con is that the phone does not come with a charger inside the box, only a C to C type cable. I ordered a 20W boat charger which works perfectly but comes at an additional cost. The biggest con I see is the display, which is very bad in outdoor conditions even when set to full brightness. If you are an outdoor person, I would recommend avoiding this phone. The phone's appearance is very basic, and the back looks very plasticky (can be covered with a case). There is no punch hole camera.

Overall, if you are someone who makes long phone calls and wants a phone with good battery life and call quality, the Samsung M14 5G is a great choice.

Update 2: I came to know that 3rd camera which is a 2MP depth does nothing here, its better to go for F14 than this as you can save approx 1k instead of buying( may be you can buy a samsung 25 w fast charger with that money), all others specs are the same. The phone feels very heavy on hand mind it.",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor/dp/B0BZCSNTT4/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-7
Komal S.,Great for light users,Reviewed in India on 5 November 2023,"Bought it for my mother and it has got all the basics right. Battery life is excellent. I am charging it with my 20 watt moto charger, it takes 1.5 hrs to fully charge with it. Easily lasts for 2 to 2.5 days in light usage like calling, WhatsApp and YouTube. Software is amazing and smooth, no lags at all.

Cons:
- Don't expect much from camera. I will say camera quality is below average, but it still does the work. Front and back both.
- Screen is IPS LCD and not amoled, so you will always feel a difference because colors are not so punchy and because of that content watching experience is not that good.
- Speaker is just decent, not very loud.",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor/dp/B0BZCSNTT4/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-7
Mahendra N Raut,Far better in 10k compared to any other mobile in the world.,Reviewed in India on 1 November 2023,"I bought this just as 5G hotspot since in my village we do not have any wired connection possible at my place.
I have to find mobile network with 4G+/5G to work and place mobile for good connectivity and this is the best thing I found.
1. It has 5G bands needed on both Airtel/Jio
2. Carrier aggregation supported and thats great thing available in such low cost device.
3. I can use hotspot for full day without worrying about battery.
4. Screen is good compared to the price.
5. My Hotspot is able to store/transfer 105GB of data :D
6. It does support installing android apps ;p

Harsh Morasiya,Worth it,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2023,"So I am just waiting to write this review after few days of usage, and here Im writing it, after using it for 10 days. The phone is worth of the price I got it at ₹11500 in Amazon great Indian sale & this is 6gb-128gb varient. It doesn't have Amoled display but yes it does comes u with PLS IPS display. Also it has 90hz refresh rate
Things to keep in mind:-
1. It has a big battery setup of 6000mah so it take good amount to charge
2. It doesn't come with adaptor, no Mobile case, and cable is also type C to type c , so you cannot use it with your old USB cable. So either buy converter pin or buy original Samsung type c adaptor
3. It's camera is very good in night also
4. It's a decent phone which also look quite big but fit comfortably in hands.
Overall great experience in this 10days no heating issue nothing.

K.Chandramouli,A well priced 5G phone,Reviewed in India on 8 November 2023,"It is a standard Samsung phone with lots of bloatware ,only some of which can be removed. The screen resolution is good for the price. The 6GB/128GB version is quite fast and wifi connectivity is good. The fingerprint sensor is very poor and takes several tries to work. The camera is okay and takes reasonably good photos in daylight. Not great for night shots. The battery lasts for over 1.5 days on a single charge with normal use of phone,video,music..etc. Overall it's a great buy at this price ,though hardcore gamers will have to look elsewhere for a suitable phone.",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor/dp/B0BZCSNTT4/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-7

Mohit S.,Decent phone at this price,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2023,"Everything is fine in this phone , but I noticed 2 problems with this phone
1. Ram management is poor, phone doesn't keeps recent apps in background. Apps will restart. So it is recommended to buy 6gb varient instead of 4 gb.
2. Sometimes sound on this phone suddenly stops, it may be due to I got a defective unit or may be every phone has same issue. When I restart the phone or turn on silent/vibration mode and then switch to sound mode then phone volume comes back.
Rest everything is good according to the price.
1. Battery is super
2. 5g works well
3. Display is decent
4. Camera is average

Atul K.,camera quality is not good as expected.,Reviewed in India on 14 July 2023," Samsung Glaxy A30(2019) Camera quality is more better than Samsung Galaxy M14 5g because it's using only 12 mp only rear and front camera. 50 mp is only for 50 mp photoshoot mode other than useless.
nature photo is oversaturated but selfie is good . No clarity in zooming. Night mode is only for image not for Video recording.
camera is like 12k rs range phone. you got only brand name and processor. one ui is ok.

Overall camera spec -Rear 12 mp [1080p 30fps max rear and front.]
- Front 12 mp
You can record 4k video in open camera. and you can also record 1080p 60fps in open camera.
Main camera not support 4k video recording.

i have problem with my m14 device, "" when i insert a micro sd card then phone restarting again and again.i have samsung sd card 256 gb.
solution - when i inserted sd card in running phone then problem solve but after restarting the phone ,same problem created.

display have low saturation and very low brightness . not visible in sun light.
no any control for adjust saturation. my old nokia 3.1 plus display saturation is better than this 5g phone.
wifi and hotspot not working at same time and setting is removed that allow this feature.

Overall Good non chinese phone . you can also go for motog52 if you don't want 5g phone ,moto g52 is better for content watching.",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor/dp/B0BZCSNTT4/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-7

Ankush Kumar,Basic features are missing...,Reviewed in India on 28 May 2023,"There is no option to Hide Apps. No App Lock or any such option to hide the many apps which you may not use. The UI version is T edition and that is not even mentioned on the website. The previous UI versions and the option to enable Hide Apps or Lock Apps is listed on Realme website. I use the feature of Hide Apps on all my phones and so it was a disappointment here. Call to customer care did not get a confirmation if that will be available in future updates.
- There is no option to private storagefor photo and videos. In all my other phones I have this option and even on the cheaper that Realme ones. Again a disappointment for me and as before no confirmation from customer care about future update.
- Call recording options- In what seems to be a bizzare setting, the recording is split into two - one to record all calls from numbers not in your contact list and the other for Selected numbers which would require you to start adding all your contacts one by one painfully. There is no simple option to record all calls. For someone with maybe 200 or more contacts it is a hard day's work. You have to click Choose contact and from the next screen of all listed contacts, select a contact which takes you back to the previous screen. You have to again click Choose contact to select your next contact. Very tiring and cumbersome and I am not sure why Realme had to complicate this simple option into something so confounding. Real disappointment for me there.

Keeping these three issues aside, I loved this phone every bit.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-Feather-Segment-Charging-Slimmest/dp/B0CKN56PQ8/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-8
Rohan Kumar Mishra,Honest review and pros and cons,Reviewed in India on 29 July 2023,"Here is my honest review of the realme narzo N53 smartphone:

Pros:

Fast charging - The 33W fast charging allows the phone's 5,000 mAh battery to charge very quickly. realme claims it can charge to 50% in just 28 minutes.
Slim design - At 7.99mm thick, realme says this is the slimmest phone in its price segment. The featherweight design makes it comfortable to hold.
90Hz display - The 6.6"" FHD+ display has a 90Hz refresh rate for smooth scrolling and transitions. Good for gaming and multimedia.
Decent hardware - It has a MediaTek Helio G85 processor, up to 6GB RAM and 128GB storage which is decent hardware for the price. Gaming performance should be smooth.
Cons:

Average camera - The 50MP main camera is decent but night photography and low light shots may not be great. Lacks high-end camera features like OIS.
Older software - Ships with Android 11, not the latest Android 12. Support for software updates is unclear.
Plastic build - The featherlight design is thanks to a plastic body rather than glass or metal. It doesn't feel very premium.
Overall, the narzo N53 offers good fast charging, a slim and light design, smooth 90Hz display and decent performance for the price. But the cameras, software and build quality could be better. For budget smartphone buyers who prioritize fast charging and design, it's worth considering. But those wanting the best camera or software may want to look at other options.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-Feather-Segment-Charging-Slimmest/dp/B0CKN56PQ8/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-8

Palash Nath Das,The camera advertisement is Fake! Be aware of the frauds.,Reviewed in India on 17 July 2023,"Whenever you get this phone, just install any hardware info software and check for the camera, the front(selfie) camera is OK. But the rear camera is just 8mp where they advertising by saying that this phone has 50+2 mp camera. All is a false advertising. And also the advertisement is showing that an 18 Watt charger will be in the box. But when you get the box, it is just a 10 Watt charger. And most of all, the phone doesn't supports Fast charging, because I have a 22 watt fast charger, but it doesn't work with it.

Otherwise the phone is good for its money because it has 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal storage. And it gets a littile bit hot when doing heavy tasks, but that's fine.",https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Power-Black-128GB-Storage/dp/B09Y64H8VS/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-9

am.pere,Good built great price,Reviewed in India on 21 March 2023,"Firstly, the design of the phone is sleek and modern, with a slim profile that makes it easy to hold and carry around. The 6.5-inch FHD+ display is crystal clear and provides a great viewing experience for watching videos or playing games.

The performance of the Redmi 10 Power is exceptional, thanks to the 8GB RAM and the powerful Snapdragon 662 processor. The phone runs smoothly and seamlessly, and I have not experienced any lag or slowdown even when multitasking or running resource-intensive apps.

The battery life of the Redmi 10 Power is simply outstanding. With a massive 6000mAh battery, I can easily go through an entire day of heavy usage without needing to recharge. And when I do need to charge the phone, the 18W fast charger included in the box quickly charges the battery back up.

The camera on this phone is also impressive, with a 48MP quad-camera setup that captures stunning photos and videos. The AI scene recognition and night mode features are particularly noteworthy, as they allow me to take great photos in low-light conditions.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Redmi 10 Power to anyone looking for a powerful, feature-packed smartphone at an affordable price. It is an excellent value for money, and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase",https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Power-Black-128GB-Storage/dp/B09Y64H8VS/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-9

Raghavendra,Excellent configuration at an affordable price,Reviewed in India on 2 February 2023,"The phone is a very good buy in the price range.

Pros:
- You get a massive 128 GB internal memory with a dedicated expandable memory card slot.
- 8 GB massive RAM which is more than any mid-range laptop's RAM.
- Jumbo 6000mAh battery
USB-C port with fast charging, large battery capacity.
- Good Snapdragon processor
- Call recording is available in Google Dialer. We can see this only after inserting sim.

Cons:
- No Infrared sensor. I think Redmi provides this only on their note series.
- Decent front & back cameras. Not recommended if you're looking to buy this phone primarily for photography. It only has a single camera with portrait mode. No wide lens (0.5x) and 2x zoom lens for photography. Also couldn't see AI mode in the inbuilt camera app even though it's mentioned on one of the ""lens"" type black thing near the back camera. I think it's a dummy camera. It has AI written on it.
- Screen is Corning Gorilla Glass 3. My old Redmi Note 8 had Gorilla Glass 5. So disappointed. But Gorilla Glass 3 should withstand some scratches and minor drops unless you are a rough user.

Most of these are minor cons, if you want a phone with an excellent configuration, at an affordable price, then this is a very good choice.",https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Power-Black-128GB-Storage/dp/B09Y64H8VS/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-9

Ram,Good but,Reviewed in India on 30 March 2023,"Okay lets get started... First.. i dont find any phone in this budget has 8RAM, and this features
second, 6000mah battary if good one.. Performance is good..
Quite a big long screen..
Now lets see the negative side..
In box they said its supports 18W fast charge but when i used 18w charger.. Phone had fever like 200 degree.. So better use that 10W charger which they gave in box.. Its taking too much time to full charge.
Finger print sensor is average but considered the price this is okay,

The one big negative i see is Camera.. It say 50MP back.. 5MP front but the quality of picture looks like 5MP in back camera ( then imaging the front camera)
Camera sensors could have been better..

If someone who doesn't need good camera, who planning for secondary mobile, gift for students, or someone who really need a good phone under this budget can buy this without any second thought..",https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Power-Black-128GB-Storage/dp/B09Y64H8VS/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-9

sid,A Decent Budget Phone - realme narzo 50i Prime,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2023,"The realme narzo 50i Prime is a budget smartphone that offers some decent features, but it has its limitations. The Dark Blue variant with 3 GB RAM and 32 GB storage provides adequate performance for day-to-day tasks.

The phone's octa-core processor handles basic applications and multitasking fairly well. It's not the fastest in its class, but for the price, it gets the job done.

The 5000 mAh battery is one of the standout features of this device. It provides ample power to keep the phone running throughout the day, which is great for users who rely on their smartphones for various tasks.

However, it's worth noting that this phone lacks 5G connectivity, which might be a drawback for some users looking for faster data speeds. In the same price range, some competitors offer 5G capabilities, so this is something to consider if you require faster internet access.

The build quality is average, and the design is pretty standard. It won't turn heads, but it's functional and feels comfortable to hold.

In conclusion, the realme narzo 50i Prime is a budget-friendly smartphone that offers decent performance and a reliable battery. However, the absence of 5G capabilities might be a deal-breaker for users who prioritize faster network speeds. If you're looking for an affordable phone for basic tasks and don't need 5G, it's worth considering.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-Storage-Octa-core-Processor-Battery/dp/B0BBM78DMV/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-10

Reshma Narkhede,Average Budget Phone with Some Limitations,Reviewed in India on 7 September 2023,"I recently purchased the Realme Narzo 50i Prime in Dark Blue with 4GB RAM and 64GB Storage. While it has its strengths, it also falls short in some key areas.

Pros:
1. **Affordable Price**: The Realme Narzo 50i Prime is a budget-friendly phone, making it accessible for those looking for an affordable smartphone.

2. **Decent Battery Life**: The 5000 mAh battery is one of the phone's standout features. It provides a good amount of juice to last through a day of moderate use.

3. **Smooth Performance**: The octa-core processor handles everyday tasks and apps reasonably well, ensuring smooth operation for the most part.

Cons:
1. **Display Quality**: The display leaves much to be desired. Colors appear washed out, and the resolution is not sharp. It's a significant drawback, especially for media consumption.

2. **Camera Performance**: The camera setup on this phone is rather basic. While it can capture decent photos in well-lit conditions, low-light photography is disappointing, and there's a noticeable lack of detail in images.

3. **Limited RAM**: With only 4GB of RAM, the phone struggles with multitasking, and apps tend to reload frequently. This can be frustrating for users who like to switch between apps quickly.

4. **Bloatware**: The Realme Narzo 50i Prime comes with a fair amount of pre-installed bloatware, which can be annoying. You'll need to spend some time uninstalling or disabling unnecessary apps.

5. **Build Quality**: The phone feels a bit plasticky and not as sturdy as some of its competitors in the same price range.

Overall, the Realme Narzo 50i Prime is an okay budget phone. If you're on a tight budget and prioritize battery life and basic functionality over display quality and camera performance, it might be worth considering. However, if you can stretch your budget a bit, there are better options available in the market that offer a more well-rounded smartphone experience.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-Storage-Octa-core-Processor-Battery/dp/B0BBM78DMV/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-10

Biswas T.,Product is so so,Reviewed in India on 1 July 2023,"Yesterday ordered this phone due to some urgency. Delivery received yesterday also. Configured the phone. It's a phone under 8k. Not good, but so so It is handy phone with 4+64 as well as there is Memory Card Tray also. Some of pre-installed games as well as snapchat, mojo, etc. were there, which needs time to uninstall. No Screen Guard / Tampered Glass on the phone screen. No Plascic Back Cover is there also, which really needed. The company can add hardware also for 'Fingerprint Sensor', this is the disadvantage of the phone, as the fingerpriint sensor is much more secured than the pass lock or face lock. Another thing you can't change the icon shaping, By default it is round, which I hate round shape icons on phone. I'm using Oneplus Nord 2T also, which has the features in software. Not comparing this Narzo with One plus, but they could provide this. Camera quality is so so. Now-a-days normal phone dialer is getting replaced by Google dialer, which has the call recording option, but in this case both of the parties can hear that their calls are getting recorded. They could bypass like Samsung, as Samsung has their own dialer with call recording facility.
After one day of using it returned it to Amazon. Charging speed is very slow and incoming calls from any person is not clear. When I call back then it's ok. Not happy",https://www.amazon.in/realme-Storage-Octa-core-Processor-Battery/dp/B0BBM78DMV/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-10

Sad it was not mentioned in the details page when I purchased. I have also bought a case along with the phone.

The phone is just easy like my previous note 8 pro which I still use. Build quality of both the phones are good. Not facing any heating issues as of now.

Sreelal D.B,Amoled Screen for this less... Incredible!,Reviewed in India on 20 October 2023,"Ordered and Same day delivered. Got it for 9300, which was literally a steal. The Amoled Screen is wonderful. The 5000mah battery lasts 1.5 to 2 days. Charges quite fast without heating(both charger and phone). The phone is quite handy and light weight.

I am not a gamer and hence I find the processor Snapdragon 685 good enough or more for everyday tasks. Camera is average, still gives good photos in good light conditions. fingerprint reader is fast and error free. No network issues, no hanging or software problems. I find the speaker loud and clear enough.
Overall it's an excellent deal for the price point of view.

10. Easy to hold and comfortable in hand
11. Finishing, glossy colour is minimalistic design
12. New One ui core is more feature rich and looks like full one ui
13. Security is my priyority to buy samsung mobile
Cons:
1. Device is bulky, large and heavy
2. Device become warm in normal use, that affect battery back up a little bit.
3. There is sudden play at back cover(Samsung need to strict its qc team)
4. Device stalls for a bit(2-4seconds, no touch response occurs then everything is ok)) during games and youtube(bug need to fix)
5. During games dont know why sound from the speaker distort and lags, but during youtube and other multimedia consumption sound is normal(I think bug need to fix)
6. During multimedia playback back cover potrion of speacker become warm
7. Also problem with proximity sensors. They wouldn't work properly on the 1st 2 call of day. Then they work properly

I dont know the problems are only in my unit or other users also facing same problem. When i bought this phone there was only option to return the device no replacement. I don't had spare phone. Thats why I had to keep the device. Amazon executive ran diagnosis test, no problem found. Went to cutomer service. There also no problem found. They updated software and that also can't solve the problems.",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor/dp/B0BZCSSNV7/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-13
Trusted reviews,A Solid Choice for Long Phone Calls and Battery Life,Reviewed in India on 16 October 2023,"Before settling on the Samsung M14 5G, I was considering three different models: the Redmi 12 5G, Moto G54 5G, and M14. Through my research, I found that the G54 had heating issues and the Redmi 12 had camera issues. As a general user who was looking for a good phone with good battery life and good call quality, I ultimately chose the M14.

In terms of network capabilities, this phone works best on 5G/4G and supports 13 bands on 5G, VOWIFI, and has 4G aggression which works seamlessly. The only feature missed was VONR. One feature that I found particularly useful is voice focus, which cuts background noise perfectly( particularly when you are train or noisy environment). The phone also has dedicated slots for SIM and SDCard.

Battery backup is amazing and can sustain for at least 2 days no matter how you use it. However, the camera is average and the rear camera is worse than the front camera. The Samsung UI is very good and supports dual apps (dual WhatsApp), and RAM management is good, though most of the time only 2GB of RAM is free. If you have a Samsung TV, this phone works flawlessly with it.

The phone comes with the latest Android 13 out of the box, and Samsung guarantees updates for OS and security updates which is a plus. The speaker is loud enough for calls and listening to YouTube videos. There are no bloatware apps, though there are a few that can be uninstalled.

One major con is that the phone does not come with a charger inside the box, only a C to C type cable. I ordered a 20W boat charger which works perfectly but comes at an additional cost. The biggest con I see is the display, which is very bad in outdoor conditions even when set to full brightness. If you are an outdoor person, I would recommend avoiding this phone. The phone's appearance is very basic, and the back looks very plasticky (can be covered with a case). There is no punch hole camera.

Overall, if you are someone who makes long phone calls and wants a phone with good battery life and call quality, the Samsung M14 5G is a great choice.

Update 2: I came to know that 3rd camera which is a 2MP depth does nothing here, its better to go for F14 than this as you can save approx 1k instead of buying( may be you can buy a samsung 25 w fast charger with that money), all others specs are the same. The phone feels very heavy on hand mind it.",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor/dp/B0BZCSSNV7/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-13
Komal S.,Great for light users,Reviewed in India on 5 November 2023,"Bought it for my mother and it has got all the basics right. Battery life is excellent. I am charging it with my 20 watt moto charger, it takes 1.5 hrs to fully charge with it. Easily lasts for 2 to 2.5 days in light usage like calling, WhatsApp and YouTube. Software is amazing and smooth, no lags at all.

Cons:
- Don't expect much from camera. I will say camera quality is below average, but it still does the work. Front and back both.

Mahendra N Raut,Far better in 10k compared to any other mobile in the world.,Reviewed in India on 1 November 2023,"I bought this just as 5G hotspot since in my village we do not have any wired connection possible at my place.
I have to find mobile network with 4G+/5G to work and place mobile for good connectivity and this is the best thing I found.
1. It has 5G bands needed on both Airtel/Jio
2. Carrier aggregation supported and thats great thing available in such low cost device.
3. I can use hotspot for full day without worrying about battery.
4. Screen is good compared to the price.
5. My Hotspot is able to store/transfer 105GB of data :D
6. It does support installing android apps ;p

*Note: This solved my purpose as a 5G/4G+ hotspots and that was a whole purpose my purchase*",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor/dp/B0BZCSSNV7/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-13

Harsh Morasiya,Worth it,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2023,"So I am just waiting to write this review after few days of usage, and here Im writing it, after using it for 10 days. The phone is worth of the price I got it at ₹11500 in Amazon great Indian sale & this is 6gb-128gb varient. It doesn't have Amoled display but yes it does comes u with PLS IPS display. Also it has 90hz refresh rate
Things to keep in mind:-
1. It has a big battery setup of 6000mah so it take good amount to charge
2. It doesn't come with adaptor, no Mobile case, and cable is also type C to type c , so you cannot use it with your old USB cable. So either buy converter pin or buy original Samsung type c adaptor
3. It's camera is very good in night also
4. It's a decent phone which also look quite big but fit comfortably in hands.
Overall great experience in this 10days no heating issue nothing.
Also Samsung service is above all other phones.",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor/dp/B0BZCSSNV7/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-13
K.Chandramouli,A well priced 5G phone,Reviewed in India on 8 November 2023,"It is a standard Samsung phone with lots of bloatware ,only some of which can be removed. The screen resolution is good for the price. The 6GB/128GB version is quite fast and wifi connectivity is good. The fingerprint sensor is very poor and takes several tries to work. The camera is okay and takes reasonably good photos in daylight. Not great for night shots. The battery lasts for over 1.5 days on a single charge with normal use of phone,video,music..etc. Overall it's a great buy at this price ,though hardcore gamers will have to look elsewhere for a suitable phone.",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Segments-Smartphone-Octa-Core-Processor/dp/B0BZCSSNV7/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-13

Mohit S.,Decent phone at this price,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2023,"Everything is fine in this phone , but I noticed 2 problems with this phone
1. Ram management is poor, phone doesn't keeps recent apps in background. Apps will restart. So it is recommended to buy 6gb varient instead of 4 gb.
2. Sometimes sound on this phone suddenly stops, it may be due to I got a defective unit or may be every phone has same issue. When I restart the phone or turn on silent/vibration mode and then switch to sound mode then phone volume comes back.
Rest everything is good according to the price.
1. Battery is super
2. 5g works well
3. Display is decent
4. Camera is average

Atul K.,camera quality is not good as expected.,Reviewed in India on 14 July 2023," Samsung Glaxy A30(2019) Camera quality is more better than Samsung Galaxy M14 5g because it's using only 12 mp only rear and front camera. 50 mp is only for 50 mp photoshoot mode other than useless.
nature photo is oversaturated but selfie is good . No clarity in zooming. Night mode is only for image not for Video recording.
camera is like 12k rs range phone. you got only brand name and processor. one ui is ok.

Overall camera spec -Rear 12 mp [1080p 30fps max rear and front.]
- Front 12 mp
You can record 4k video in open camera. and you can also record 1080p 60fps in open camera.
Main camera not support 4k video recording.

i have problem with my m14 device, "" when i insert a micro sd card then phone restarting again and again.i have samsung sd card 256 gb.
solution - when i inserted sd card in running phone then problem solve but after restarting the phone ,same problem created.

display have low saturation and very low brightness . not visible in sun light.
no any control for adjust saturation. my old nokia 3.1 plus display saturation is better than this 5g phone.
wifi and hotspot not working at same time and setting is removed that allow this feature.

sid,A Decent Budget Phone - realme narzo 50i Prime,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2023,"The realme narzo 50i Prime is a budget smartphone that offers some decent features, but it has its limitations. The Dark Blue variant with 3 GB RAM and 32 GB storage provides adequate performance for day-to-day tasks.

The phone's octa-core processor handles basic applications and multitasking fairly well. It's not the fastest in its class, but for the price, it gets the job done.

The 5000 mAh battery is one of the standout features of this device. It provides ample power to keep the phone running throughout the day, which is great for users who rely on their smartphones for various tasks.

However, it's worth noting that this phone lacks 5G connectivity, which might be a drawback for some users looking for faster data speeds. In the same price range, some competitors offer 5G capabilities, so this is something to consider if you require faster internet access.

The build quality is average, and the design is pretty standard. It won't turn heads, but it's functional and feels comfortable to hold.

In conclusion, the realme narzo 50i Prime is a budget-friendly smartphone that offers decent performance and a reliable battery. However, the absence of 5G capabilities might be a deal-breaker for users who prioritize faster network speeds. If you're looking for an affordable phone for basic tasks and don't need 5G, it's worth considering.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-Storage-Octa-core-Processor-Battery/dp/B0BBM7L888/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-14

Reshma Narkhede,Average Budget Phone with Some Limitations,Reviewed in India on 7 September 2023,"I recently purchased the Realme Narzo 50i Prime in Dark Blue with 4GB RAM and 64GB Storage. While it has its strengths, it also falls short in some key areas.

Pros:
1. **Affordable Price**: The Realme Narzo 50i Prime is a budget-friendly phone, making it accessible for those looking for an affordable smartphone.

2. **Decent Battery Life**: The 5000 mAh battery is one of the phone's standout features. It provides a good amount of juice to last through a day of moderate use.

3. **Smooth Performance**: The octa-core processor handles everyday tasks and apps reasonably well, ensuring smooth operation for the most part.

Cons:
1. **Display Quality**: The display leaves much to be desired. Colors appear washed out, and the resolution is not sharp. It's a significant drawback, especially for media consumption.

2. **Camera Performance**: The camera setup on this phone is rather basic. While it can capture decent photos in well-lit conditions, low-light photography is disappointing, and there's a noticeable lack of detail in images.

3. **Limited RAM**: With only 4GB of RAM, the phone struggles with multitasking, and apps tend to reload frequently. This can be frustrating for users who like to switch between apps quickly.

4. **Bloatware**: The Realme Narzo 50i Prime comes with a fair amount of pre-installed bloatware, which can be annoying. You'll need to spend some time uninstalling or disabling unnecessary apps.

5. **Build Quality**: The phone feels a bit plasticky and not as sturdy as some of its competitors in the same price range.

Overall, the Realme Narzo 50i Prime is an okay budget phone. If you're on a tight budget and prioritize battery life and basic functionality over display quality and camera performance, it might be worth considering. However, if you can stretch your budget a bit, there are better options available in the market that offer a more well-rounded smartphone experience.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-Storage-Octa-core-Processor-Battery/dp/B0BBM7L888/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-14

Biswas T.,Product is so so,Reviewed in India on 1 July 2023,"Yesterday ordered this phone due to some urgency. Delivery received yesterday also. Configured the phone. It's a phone under 8k. Not good, but so so It is handy phone with 4+64 as well as there is Memory Card Tray also. Some of pre-installed games as well as snapchat, mojo, etc. were there, which needs time to uninstall. No Screen Guard / Tampered Glass on the phone screen. No Plascic Back Cover is there also, which really needed. The company can add hardware also for 'Fingerprint Sensor', this is the disadvantage of the phone, as the fingerpriint sensor is much more secured than the pass lock or face lock. Another thing you can't change the icon shaping, By default it is round, which I hate round shape icons on phone. I'm using Oneplus Nord 2T also, which has the features in software. Not comparing this Narzo with One plus, but they could provide this. Camera quality is so so. Now-a-days normal phone dialer is getting replaced by Google dialer, which has the call recording option, but in this case both of the parties can hear that their calls are getting recorded. They could bypass like Samsung, as Samsung has their own dialer with call recording facility.
After one day of using it returned it to Amazon. Charging speed is very slow and incoming calls from any person is not clear. When I call back then it's ok. Not happy",https://www.amazon.in/realme-Storage-Octa-core-Processor-Battery/dp/B0BBM7L888/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-14

SOVON,Value for Money under 6k,Reviewed in India on 10 August 2023,"I have purchased this phone for my mother, this is her first smart phone so i thought i should go for a simple smartphone with clean ui with a large battery. So bought this. Now let's talk about the pros and cons

Pros:
1. Large screen: the screen is really big and colours are bright.
2. Large battery: 5000 mah battery is really useful, my mother doesn't use the phone too much so it's last for 2 to 3 days with minimal usage.
3. Android go : it has the Android 13 go edition so it's light version that's why it's working smooth.
4. Dual rear camera does it's job but the front camera is really impressive.
5.Dialer: It has Xiaomi dialer so you can record call without announcement.

Cons :

1. No type C port so we have to carry an extra cable as all of our phone has type C port.
2. Long Charging time: no fast charging provided so it's taking longer time to charge the battery.
3. No widget options ( till now August 2023) so you can't add weather or clock or contact widget on the home screen.
4. No double tap to screen on/off feature ( till now Aug 2023).
5. It's taking time to load videos or the settings options on 2gb variant, i mean if i open YouTube it's taking 4 to 5 second to load the videos on YouTube ( I'm using the device on WiFi so no network issue, it's happening for the weak processor). I have installed WhatsApp from play store, nothing else installed on the phone but still it's taking some times for some app loading. But it's okay it's not a issue for someone who just started using smartphone.

Also you can uninstall or disable maximum of preloaded apps. I have uninstalled maximum of those apps. Also I have disabled the Chrome browser, as my mother didn't search any thing on internet. I have disabled the browser so even if my mother clicked on any link on YouTube or on another apps it doesn't work so kind of safe for my mother also.

So i just want to say this phone is just for calling, WhatsApp, for normal YouTube videos & music. Also i think if you are getting the 2GB variant under 6k then it's a good deal. Don't pay more for this even if you are buying 4gb 64gb it will not change much on the performance.
Thank you.

Edit 1 : Even after getting 3 software updates they didn't include the widgets option as well as the double tap function. So i think this option will not available in future also, may be this features are not for Android go editions. So keep that in mind, although my mother never complaint about the clok as she check the time from the notification bar or from the lock screen.",https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Sea-Green-64GB-Storage/dp/B0C74PD9VG/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-15
Nj,Drawbacks of this model,Reviewed in India on 9 November 2023,"There are some serious drawbacks with this model , I hve listed it here.
Yes,the phone is cheap N ideal only if ur usage is not heavy.If ur a heavy user then go fr a better model.

* No proper switch given to toggle between the modes (normal, outdoor, silent) and can't switch properly due to this,when in vibrate the ring n volume is still the same n doesn't get muted.

* The outdoor mode of screen display doesn't work properly n shows heated msg even when its not.

* Compass doesn't work or isn't supported in this model bcos it doesn't hve the necessary sensors needed.

* when using multiple apps can't use whatsapp chat as it doesn't allow the user to reply to the msgs.

* very poor or minimal image editing and camera options,whch r utterly useless.

* Themes doesn't work properly n it's menu options are not proper.

* When on call the voice of the other person can be heard outside also whch is again pathetic.

* The torch light is not bright enough",https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Sea-Green-64GB-Storage/dp/B0C74PD9VG/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-15

Raghavendra P,Redmi A2: Affordable Excellence with Impressive Features,Reviewed in India on 23 June 2023,"After using it for a month, I can state , the Redmi A2 (Classic Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) is an excellent budget smartphone that delivers impressive features and performance. From its vibrant display to its capable cameras and long-lasting battery, it offers a well-rounded experience for the price. If you are looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone, I highly recommend considering the Redmi A2.

Pros:

1. Great value for money: The Redmi A2 offers an impressive range of features and performance at an affordable price point.
2. Vibrant display: The 6.52-inch IPS LCD screen delivers sharp and clear visuals, making it enjoyable for multimedia consumption.
3. Smooth performance: The Mediatek Helio G36 chipset, coupled with the octa-core processor and 4GB RAM, ensures smooth multitasking and lag-free performance.
4. Expandable storage: The device comes with 64GB of internal storage, which can be further expanded using the dedicated microSDXC card slot, providing ample space for your files and apps.
5. Decent camera performance: The dual rear cameras capture satisfactory photos with good detail and color accuracy, and the addition of features like dual-LED flash and HDR enhances the camera's capabilities.
6. Long-lasting battery: The 5000mAh non-removable battery offers excellent battery life, allowing for a full day of usage without worrying about running out of power.
7. User-friendly interface: The Redmi A2 runs on Android 13 (Go edition) with MIUI, providing a user-friendly interface and a range of customization options.
8. Sleek design: The device boasts a sleek and slim design, with the Classic Black color variant adding an elegant touch.
9. Added benefit is warranty - 2 years [1 year + extra 1 year (special introductory offer)]
Cons:

1. Moderate display resolution: While the display is vibrant, the 720 x 1600 pixel resolution may not offer the highest level of sharpness compared to higher-end devices.
2. Modest camera setup: The camera setup on the Redmi A2 is modest, which may not satisfy users who require advanced camera capabilities.
3. Limited charging speed: The device supports 10W wired charging, which is not as fast as some other smartphones in the market.

Please be aware that these benefits and drawbacks are based on individual usage and may change based on preferences and usage patterns.",https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Sea-Green-64GB-Storage/dp/B0C74PD9VG/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-15

Ahamed,Ok to have,Reviewed in India on 1 November 2023,"Overall product is good for beginner users,
There is no option to add a date and time in the wallpaper(No widget)
there is no option for pattern lock, when it came they said it support face lock but it did not.
the only option for security is the pin number,(keep in mind that no biometric )
screen shot facilities are also not there, meaning software like in setting or the three finger method, you have to press the volume down and power button at the same time.",https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Sea-Green-64GB-Storage/dp/B0C74PD9VG/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-15

Arpan Bhattacharya,"A good product in this price range, with some minor drawbacks",Reviewed in India on 10 July 2023,"Before saying anything about A2, I would like to mention properly that is a below ₹7,000 smartphone. In this slab of pricing, Xiaomi has packed a USB charger, decent battery which goes on from 13-15 hours in good use (non gaming, movie etc) in single charge.
Camera is good, not exceptional.
The OS feels like Stock Android. As Classic MIUI Apps seemed missing by me like notes, compass, IR Remote.
Does not support 5GHz Wifi. Works smooth on 2.4Ghz Wifi.
The built qualify is simply AWESOME. Feel in hand is Awesome.
Brithness is pretty good, touch and response time is very smooth and fast. Bootup time is pretty fast too.
Comes with a dedicated SD Card slot along with dual sim slots (total 3 slots in tray).
In box they have packed the phone, charger, USB type A-B cable. (No tempered glass or back cover), No fingerprint or face unlock - REMEMBER THE PRICE.

Final conclusion: the phone is good in this price range specially the smoothness, built quality, screen size, clean Android OS with majority Google's Apps like Google One, Google Gallery etc. Yes some small small things are missing but that is fine because the price is also kept pretty low. The Phone is good for those who have average use of smartphones or if you want to make this as a secondary business need smartphone. Or simply a phone for a school student.

I recommend this product untill and unless Redmi asks you to pay more than ₹7500.",https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Sea-Green-64GB-Storage/dp/B0C74PD9VG/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-15

Neeraj Yadav,realme Narzo 60X 5G,Reviewed in India on 11 October 2023,"realme Narzo 60 5G आखिरकार आ चुका है। अगर आप भी इस फोन को खरीदने के बारे में सोच रहे थे तो हम कुछ चीजों के बारे में बताने जा रहे हैं। इसकी मदद से आप इस फोन को काफी आसानी से बंपर डिस्काउंट के साथ ऑर्डर कर सकते हैं। यही वजह है कि इसे ऑर्डर करने से पहले आपको डिजाइन, डिस्प्ले, परफॉर्मेंस और कैमरे के बारे में जरूर जान लेना चाहिए
इसके पप्राइमरी कैमरा से तस्वीरें अच्छी आती हैं, लेकिन ये रंगों को थोड़ा बूस्ट कर देता है। हालांकि डिटेल अच्छी मिलती है। हमने इसे बहुत ज़्यादा टेस्ट नहीं किया है, लेकिन आप कुछ कैमरा सैंपल नीचे देख सकते हैं।मैंने इसे कुछ ही समय इस्तेमाल किया है, जिसमें कई ऐप्स एक साथ चलायीं, कॉलिंग भी की और इस दौरान मुझे कोई लैग नहीं दिखा।
सॉफ्टवेयर साइड पर, Narzo 60x में Android 13 आधारित realmeUI 4.0 है। फ़ोन में कई ऐप्स पहले से मौजूद हैं, जैसे FinShell Pay, Paytm, Linkedin, Candy Crush, Josh, Netflix, Royal Match Game, इत्यादि।
Realme के इस नए बजट फ़ोन में भी 5,000 mAh की ही बैटरी है और फ़ोन के साथ आपको चार्जिंग केबल और 33W का अडैप्टर मिलता है। इस चार्जर के साथ फ़ोन को 0 से 100% तक चार्ज होने में लगभग 75-80 मिनट का समय लगता है। मेरे इस्तेमाल के दौरान में थोड़ी कंटेंट स्ट्रीमिंग की और बाकी कॉलिंग व कुछ ऐप्स का इस्तेमाल, तो मुझे इसे दिन भर में चार्ज करने की ज़रुरत नहीं पड़ी। फ़ोन में Power Saving Mode है, जिसके साथ ये आपको लगभग 2 दिन का बैटरी बैकअप दे सकता है।
Realme Narzo 60x की कीमत 12,999 रुपए से शुरू होती है। इस कीमत पर ये आपको एक अच्छा डिज़ाइन ऑफर करता है, ख़ासतौर से युवाओं के लिए। फ़ोन देखने में सस्तेपन का अनुभव नहीं देता। डिस्प्ले और परफॉरमेंस भी रोज़मर्रा के अनुसार संतोषजनक है। इसके अलावा इस बजट में इसकी रियर कैमरा परफॉरमेंस भी अच्छी है, हालांकि सेल्फी कैमरा हमने अभी टेस्ट नहीं किया है, इसके लिए आपको हमारे रिव्यु का इंतज़ार करना होगा।
फ़ोन में दो वैरिएंट उपलब्ध हैं और 120Hz डिस्प्ले, 50MP प्राइमरी कैमरा, 33w फ़ास्ट चार्जिंग सपोर्ट जैसे स्पेसिफिकेशन भी हैं, जो अपनी कीमत के अनुसार आपको निराश नहीं करते हैं।
Realme Narzo 60x 5G में ओक्टा कोर Dimensity 6100+ 6nm चिपसेट है। साथ में 6GB तक की LPDDR4x रैम और 128GB की UFS 2.2 स्टोरेज है। स्टोरेज आपको थोड़ी कम लग सकती है, लेकिन ऐसे में फ़ोन में मौजूद माइक्रो एसडी स्लॉट के साथ आप इसे 2TB तक बढ़ा सकते हैं। ये वही चिपसेट है, जिसके साथ पिछले महीने Realme 11x 5G को लॉन्च किया गया है। ये प्रोसेसर रोज़मर्रा के कामों को आसानी से कर लेता है। गेमिंग मैंने बहुत ज़्यादा टेस्ट नहीं की, लेकिन इस चिपसेट के साथ आप CoD और PUBG जैसे खेल भी खेल सकते हैं, लेकिन मीडियम ग्राफ़िक्स और फ्रेम रेट पर।
Realme Narzo 60x 5G में 6.72-इंच की फुल एचडी+ डिस्प्ले है। इसमें 120Hz तक की डायनामिक रिफ्रेश रेट सपोर्ट और 680 निट्स तक की पीक ब्राइटनेस मिलेगी। फ़ोन बाहर की रौशनी में रिफ्लेक्टिव है, लेकिन इस्तेमाल किया जा सकता है। स्क्रीन में भले ही 120Hz रिफ्रेश रेट सपोर्ट के साथ स्मूथ अनुभव मिलता है, लेकिन इसकी तुलना आप फ्लैगशिप फोनों से नहीं कर सकते और कीमतों के अनुसार न ही करनी चाहिए।
स्क्रीन पर हल्का ब्लू टिंट नज़र आता है, लेकिन डिस्प्ले सेटिंग्स में Screen Colour mode ऑप्शन में जाकर आप इसे Natural पर सेट करें और स्लाइडर को थोड़ा Warm साइड पर रखें, तो ये थोड़ा बेहतर हो जाता है। कुल मिलाकर इसका डिस्प्ले रोज़ के कामों के दौरान मुझे ठीक लगा।
इसमें दायीं साइड पर वॉल्यूम बटन और पावर बटन हैं और बायीं तरफ आप सिम लगा सकते हैं। निचली एज पर आपको ऑडियो जैक, माइक्रोफोन, स्पीकर और टाइप-सी पोर्ट मिलेंगे। कीमतों को देखते हुए मुझे इस फ़ोन के डिज़ाइन से कोई शिकायत नहीं है, लेकिन कवर पहले आये पारदर्शी कवरों जैसा होता, तभी बेहतर होता। Realme Narzo 60x 5G प्लास्टिक बॉडी के साथ आता है, लेकिन देखने में ये ग्लास रियर पैनल लगता है। फ़ोन पर एक बड़ा गोल कैमरा मॉड्यूल है और बाकी रियर पैनल पर आपको एक टेक्सचर नज़र आएगा। हमें ये फ़ोन हरे (Stellar Green) रंग में मिला है और इसके रियर पैनल पर जो पैटर्न या टेक्सचर है, उसे कंपनी ने InterstellarX का नाम दिया है। फ़ोन में साइड का फ्रेम भी मेटल से बना लगता है, लेकिन ये भी प्लास्टिक ही है। देखने में ये आपको आकर्षक लग सकता है, लेकिन तभी जब आपको कोई चमकता रंग पसंद हो। हालांकि सादे रंग पसंद करने वालों के लिए ये काले रंग में भी उपलब्ध है।

फ़ोन का डिज़ाइन अच्छा है, लेकिन ये पतला नहीं है। इसकी मोटाई 7.89mm है और साथ ही फ्लैट डिज़ाइन होने के कारण ये हाथ में उतना आरामदायक नहीं है, लेकिन ये समस्या आपको फ़ोन के साथ आने वाले कवर से नहीं आएगी। लेकिन इस बार कंपनी ने फ़ोन के साथ काले शेड का कवर दिया है, जिससे फ़ोन का डिज़ाइन उतना आकर्षक नहीं रह जाता। अभी तक सभी फोनों में पारदर्शी TPU कवर ही आये हैं, इसीलिए ये थोड़ा अजीब तो है।",https://www.amazon.in/realme-5G%EF%BC%88Nebula-Storage%EF%BC%89-External-Supervooc/dp/B0CGDQ7VNL/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-16
Parth,It cost me 11500(in Amazon great indian festival deal),Reviewed in India on 21 October 2023,"Camera : camera is decent.. it's average, sometimes it takes awesome pictures and sometimes don't. Not good in low light... And also boost the colors and can't catch (or idk if it's hiding) details... Like my one of friend had worn lakhnvi kurta, and after taking the pic that maroon color kurta it was looking like red color kurta and not lakhvnvi but plain kurta...😅 I've uploaded images for that... First image of kurta was taken by iphone and look at there and the second one was taken by this narzo 60x...you can see the difference... So if your priority is not camera or you are satisfied with above images you must go for it...

Sound quality: it's normal... And mostly i use wireless neckband or tws so it fine for me.....

Battery : battery backup is good, since it has big display it will use more battery, but if you use with low brightness then it gives amazing backup...

Also you should keep turning off background processes by going into setting and search process manager and end the process which you won't like to run in background and also you can freez app so they won't be used in background... As an example i use insta for watching reels only so I have freezed the app and so it won't run in background but as i open it will work normal..
This things can save much much ram and also battery...

Ease of use: ui is good, all features are available like ,
internet speed,
daily data usage,
One handed mode,
Bottom slide finger to change recent app,
Screen off gestures -> double tap turn on off, draw on lock sceeen and open some app..
Youtube background play
Etc....

Performance : it is good for regular usage, I didn't feel any leg while using the mohile, and since I don't play games, I can't say about mobile while playing games...it doesn't get heat while watching youtube and Instagram...
App opening and closing is fast...

Ram management: Ram management is good but i can't understand that virtual ram(z-ram what they called).. I didn't find any usecase of it until now...
Display: display attracted me a lot, i mean colors are too good....and I also have used it in sunlight, everything was visible properly

I also checked antutu score by myself in this device

The device has setting about refresh rate and perfomance mode

So,

with 60hz refresh rate and balance mode i got antutu score of 4,10,000

With 120hz and high perfomance mode I got 4,20,000

Note: antutu score may very depending upon any background porcess runnig or not, bluetooth wifi is on or off....and also near by temperature affect it

So try using close all the apps and also if try it with in appropriate temperature and also don't put your mobile in charging...I don't know above things will affect antutu score or not but still to be on safe side this things are necessary..",https://www.amazon.in/realme-5G%EF%BC%88Nebula-Storage%EF%BC%89-External-Supervooc/dp/B0CGDQ7VNL/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-16

Realme Narzo 60X 5G quick review: Looks good but sounds familiar
Highlights
Realme Narzo 60X 5G arrived in India today.
Realme Narzo 60X 5G starts at Rs 12,999 in India.
Realme Narzo 60X 5G will go on sale in India on September 12.
Realme Narzo 60X 5G quick review: Realme launched a new mid-budget smartphone, dubbed as the Realme Narzo 60X 5G in India today. The newly launched Realme Narzo 60X 5G is a part of the company's Narzo 60 series devices, which also includes the Realme Narzo 60 5G and the Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G smartphones. Despite being a sibling of the Narzo 60 Series, the phone seems a closer cousin of the Realme 11X 5G smartphone that was launched in India last month. Interestingly, this familiarity is not just in terms of the design but also in terms of the features.

Srajan,Amazing picture quality and Ultra Fast Charging,Reviewed in India on 8 November 2023,"This is a very good phone with all features needed for the new generation.
Some key features are:-
Good battery backup- 1 day backup after full charge on using it for about 8 hrs per day
33W supervooc charger is the best that can charge the phone from less than 10 % to 100% in 1hr.
amazing display with super smooth 120Hz rate.
Cons- I am using it for a month and I have not found any thing bad about this phone except that the realme UI features are less as compared to other brand like Redmi and Samsung.
Furthermore it does not support NFC payments.

Summary - The phone is best for a College guy for multitasking and daily use for creating assignments, reading notes and creating ppts, etc.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-5G%EF%BC%88Nebula-Storage%EF%BC%89-External-Supervooc/dp/B0CGDQ7VNL/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-16

Vishu,Honest review,Reviewed in India on 14 October 2023,"I have been using Realme Narzo 60x 5g for quite sometime so here is my review of this device.

Pros:
1. Smooth experience - This device has 120hz display, therefore it's provides smooth scrolling experience if set at 120hz.

2. Battery life - This device has good battery life once charged upto 80 percent it can last full day on normal use.

3. Fast charging - This device comes with 33 watt fast charger which can charge the 5000 mah battery of this device upto 80 percent in 1 and half hour.

Cons : 1. Sound quality - The Microphone sound volume and quality is low, this phone is not for those who use phone primarily for calling as it's sound volume is low so what other person is talking may not be audible sometimes.

2. Music sound quality is low - This is not for those who love listening music at high volume since the sound volume is low. The loudspeaker is a single speaker not dual. speaker's sound volume is not that high

3. Dull display - This device's has a big display but the display is slight yellow in colour. At first I thought night mode or eye protection is on so I checked it and it was not on. So the display is itself slight yellow in colour which can affect multimedia experience. You may not like watching YouTube videos from this device as the video appears yellowish.
Update:- After software updates the yellowness has reduced.

3. Camera -
* Front camera : The device has decent front camera which clicks good selfies but it over whiten's the skin tone so it don't look natural but the selfies
quality is decent to be uploaded in social media.
* Rear camera - The rear camera is of decent quality but it don't work very well in low light conditions. After clicking photo the device takes 2 to 3 seconds to process the image.
* Video camera - The videos shot from this device's camera is decent. This phone supports slow motion but the slow motion videos are blurry and faded.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-5G%EF%BC%88Nebula-Storage%EF%BC%89-External-Supervooc/dp/B0CGDQ7VNL/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-16

Prabeez,Narzo 60x ❤️👌,Reviewed in India on 16 October 2023,"Narzo 60x.. Such a wonderful phone at this price range.. Same as of 11x by realme.. Only camera is 50mp but more excellent than 11x as its a new camera rather than the old 64 mp one in 11x,some samples adding..
I got it for 11250 the 6/128 version and also exchange value of 2500 for my 3.5 old infinix hot 8..so was a very good deal for the shoping festival days... Now the price is 14999..
Camera is excellent but lacking image stability durinh video recording.. Also 4k not available.g Battery backup 5000mah is deceny, havent tried any games yt, but the antutu score is nearby 4.2 lakhs.. So definitely will give a medium experience👌.. Also about the display very good with 700nits and rolls out with latest Android 13 with realme UI 4 with 2years update and 3years security updates.. So you will get android 14 nd 15..thats a good thing😍..
If your getting the phone below 12500 thats a very good deal whereas the same one with number series thats 11x is just 1000rs extra for the same variants with same specs and features..
Go for it.. Its good",https://www.amazon.in/realme-5G%EF%BC%88Nebula-Storage%EF%BC%89-External-Supervooc/dp/B0CGDQ7VNL/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-16
Chitradeep Das,Worthy Deal!,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2023,"The Realme Narzo 60x 5G is a worthy device in this price range. Here is my detailed review:

1. Looks & build quality is great, its thin and classy with an impressive texture at the back.
2. Performance is average, ram management is not that good but its enough for daily use. The chipset performs well and doesn't heat.
3. Battery will last for a day with moderate uses.
4. 120hz is cool but sometimes i feel few frame drops but that lasts for a few milliseconds.
5. Camera's output is good in this range as it has an AI camera. The edge detection is great with good skin output.
6. Now the 5G part! Well its pretty good since it has 9 bands of 5G.

Only the thing I am not happy for is the UI & OS, it has many bloatwares and the phone is filled with hotapps which you can't remove. Unnecessary features loaded mades it more annoying.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-5G%EF%BC%88Nebula-Storage%EF%BC%89-External-Supervooc/dp/B0CGDQ7VNL/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-16

Mattjo,Negative Review: Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green,Reviewed in India on 31 July 2023,"The Samsung Galaxy M04 in Light Green may be budget-friendly, but it falls disappointingly short when it comes to camera performance. If you're someone who enjoys capturing life's moments with stunning clarity, this phone is bound to leave you feeling frustrated.

Camera Performance:
The 13MP primary camera on the Galaxy M04 struggles to produce satisfactory results, especially in anything less than optimal lighting conditions. Photos taken indoors or in low-light environments suffer from excessive noise and lack of detail. Even in well-lit settings, the colors appear muted, and the dynamic range is limited. The 5MP front camera is equally lackluster, producing selfies that lack sharpness and clarity. If you're a photography enthusiast, this phone simply won't meet your expectations.

Gaming Performance:
While the Galaxy M04 manages day-to-day tasks adequately, it's not designed for high-performance gaming. Graphically demanding games often suffer from lag and frame rate drops, making the gaming experience less enjoyable. If you're into heavy mobile gaming, you'd be better off considering a more powerful device.

Battery Life:
Although the 5,000mAh battery is impressive on paper, the subpar gaming performance drains the battery quickly during extended gaming sessions. While the phone may suffice for parents who use it for occasional tasks, the battery life may not last a full day under heavy usage scenarios.

Display:
The 6.3-inch HD+ LCD display is mediocre at best. While it gets the job done for casual media consumption, the lack of vibrant colors and average viewing angles fail to impress. The visual experience simply doesn't match up to other smartphones in this price range.

Software and Updates:
Samsung's One UI skin is generally user-friendly, but the budget nature of this phone means that major updates and feature enhancements might not be promptly delivered. This could lead to missing out on essential improvements and security patches.

Conclusion:
If you're a photography enthusiast or a heavy mobile gamer, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green will be a major disappointment. The lackluster camera performance, subpar gaming capabilities, and average display make it unsuitable for users who prioritize these aspects. However, if you're a parent or a casual user who primarily needs a phone for basic tasks like calls, messaging, and light browsing, the Galaxy M04 might suffice. For anything more demanding, there are better options available in the market at a similar price point.

Pros:

Suitable for parents or casual users with basic needs
Affordable price point
Cons:

Subpar camera performance in various lighting conditions
Not suitable for high-performance gaming
Mediocre display quality
Potential delays in major software updates

Placeholder,It’s good for the price you pay.,Reviewed in India on 17 November 2023,"I ordered this phone with exchange offer, got it for ~5,500 Rs. I was looking for an average phone for my mum. And this is just it.

Performance is average, smooth but slow; unexpected in a brand new phone. Camera quality is below average, but I don’t mind. Call quality is good so far. Battery life is good as well, but it’s only been 2 days.

What I don’t like is the app layout on Home Screen, and the interface design. It took me a while to get all the installed apps to Home Screen.

I didn’t face heating issues yet that some seem to complain. It’s a nice phone for an average user, a good one for the price.",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Storage-MediaTek-Octa-core-Processor/dp/B0BMGG6NKT/ref=sr_1_17?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-17

kushagra,Slow processor not for gamers,Reviewed in India on 22 October 2023,"It's been now 1 week since I'm using this product. Camera quality is okay okay.. it doesn't show natural skin rather cleanses/whitens it more than usual.
Processor is slow before you install the software update.
After updating it works fine..
Sound quality is little less if compared to my previous phone redmi7A.
Phone hangs a little bit when moved simultaneously from one app to the other .
Brief - product is all over good only for basic users like WhatsApp, YouTube, calling.
For gamers it may become problematic due to no smoothness.",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Storage-MediaTek-Octa-core-Processor/dp/B0BMGG6NKT/ref=sr_1_17?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-17

Amazon Customer,Strictly starter phone if OK with compromises,Reviewed in India on 12 November 2023,"Has decent specifications for a starter phone but has serious drawbacks due to lack certain basic features that cripple the phone.

Positives
1. Price point with reputed brand support

Negatives
1. No fingerprint scanner
2. No support for 5GHz WiFi
3. ""Always On Display"" setting is missing
4. Face recognition feature only works intermittently, possibly due to lower resolution of front facing camera
5. Battery barely lasts one day with moderate usage. Doesn't support fast charging even with manufacturer provided charger and cable",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Storage-MediaTek-Octa-core-Processor/dp/B0BMGG6NKT/ref=sr_1_17?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-17

Vishnu,Awesome,Reviewed in India on 17 August 2023,"The Samsung M04 offers a budget-friendly option with a 6.2-inch display, providing a decent viewing experience for its price point. Its performance is satisfactory for everyday tasks thanks to the Snapdragon processor and 3GB of RAM, though demanding apps or games might not run as smoothly.

The camera setup, featuring a dual-lens rear camera with a 13MP main sensor and a 2MP depth sensor, captures acceptable photos in well-lit conditions, but struggles in low light. The front-facing 5MP camera is suitable for basic selfies and video calls.

The device houses a 5,000mAh battery, which can easily last through a day of regular usage. However, charging is done through a micro-USB port, which might be a bit outdated for some users.

On the software side, the M04 runs Samsung's One UI on top of Android, providing a user-friendly experience and some customization options. As for storage, the 32GB internal storage can be expanded via microSD card for those who need more space.

In summary, the Samsung M04 is a decent budget smartphone that gets the basics done, but it's important to manage expectations given its limitations in terms of performance and camera quality, which are common trade-offs in this price range.",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Storage-MediaTek-Octa-core-Processor/dp/B0BMGG6NKT/ref=sr_1_17?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-17

Ankush Kumar,Basic features are missing...,Reviewed in India on 28 May 2023,"There is no option to Hide Apps. No App Lock or any such option to hide the many apps which you may not use. The UI version is T edition and that is not even mentioned on the website. The previous UI versions and the option to enable Hide Apps or Lock Apps is listed on Realme website. I use the feature of Hide Apps on all my phones and so it was a disappointment here. Call to customer care did not get a confirmation if that will be available in future updates.
- There is no option to private storagefor photo and videos. In all my other phones I have this option and even on the cheaper that Realme ones. Again a disappointment for me and as before no confirmation from customer care about future update.
- Call recording options- In what seems to be a bizzare setting, the recording is split into two - one to record all calls from numbers not in your contact list and the other for Selected numbers which would require you to start adding all your contacts one by one painfully. There is no simple option to record all calls. For someone with maybe 200 or more contacts it is a hard day's work. You have to click Choose contact and from the next screen of all listed contacts, select a contact which takes you back to the previous screen. You have to again click Choose contact to select your next contact. Very tiring and cumbersome and I am not sure why Realme had to complicate this simple option into something so confounding. Real disappointment for me there.

Keeping these three issues aside, I loved this phone every bit.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-Feather-Segment-Charging-Slimmest/dp/B0C45N5VPT/ref=sr_1_18?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-18
Rohan Kumar Mishra,Honest review and pros and cons,Reviewed in India on 29 July 2023,"Here is my honest review of the realme narzo N53 smartphone:

Pros:

Fast charging - The 33W fast charging allows the phone's 5,000 mAh battery to charge very quickly. realme claims it can charge to 50% in just 28 minutes.
Slim design - At 7.99mm thick, realme says this is the slimmest phone in its price segment. The featherweight design makes it comfortable to hold.
90Hz display - The 6.6"" FHD+ display has a 90Hz refresh rate for smooth scrolling and transitions. Good for gaming and multimedia.
Decent hardware - It has a MediaTek Helio G85 processor, up to 6GB RAM and 128GB storage which is decent hardware for the price. Gaming performance should be smooth.
Cons:

Average camera - The 50MP main camera is decent but night photography and low light shots may not be great. Lacks high-end camera features like OIS.
Older software - Ships with Android 11, not the latest Android 12. Support for software updates is unclear.
Plastic build - The featherlight design is thanks to a plastic body rather than glass or metal. It doesn't feel very premium.
Overall, the narzo N53 offers good fast charging, a slim and light design, smooth 90Hz display and decent performance for the price. But the cameras, software and build quality could be better. For budget smartphone buyers who prioritize fast charging and design, it's worth considering. But those wanting the best camera or software may want to look at other options.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-Feather-Segment-Charging-Slimmest/dp/B0C45N5VPT/ref=sr_1_18?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-18

Brahmadath,Good hardware with mediocre software,Reviewed in India on 19 September 2023,"This review is based on just one day of usage.

Likes

1.The hardware- the hardware is topnotch for the price. The chipset is fairly decent, cameras are good (not great, but usable images), speakers are above average. Screen is also perfectly usable. Full hd screen with 90 hz refresh rate. Fingerprint sensor is accurate and quick. No heating issues as of now (I haven't used the phone extensively; see other reviews for heating).
2. Charging- it is the best feature of this product. The charging is truly best in class. Half filled the phone from zero in just under 30 minutes.
3. Battery- again very good. The chipset being sub-flagship is very conservative in battery consumption. As a result, phone easily last more than a day. I charged it yesterday at noon and I still have around 30% left at 7 pm today.

Mediocre

1. Camera- not best in class. The back camera is decent under good lighting. But quickly looses it when the light fades. Night photography is not good. Selfie camera too is not very good, but still give usable photos in good lighting. Again, I bought this phone for my mom, photography is not her strong point! So, it's perfectly fine for her as it gets the job done most of the times.
2. Features- the system has good features such as overnight charging, minimised screen, gesture shortcuts etc. But the overall experience of the UI is ruined by ads, which is the number one problem I have with this phone.

Dislikes

1. Ads ads ads. Everywhere you look, there are ads. There are ads in the app launcher, there are ads each time you install an app, there are ads when you clear cache using the native cleaner app. There are apps installed on its own without even giving permission. I spend so much time removing all the unnecessary apps and after sometime, some of them came back. The realme app store is the culprit, I believe. Because, after disabling the store, the installing of apps on their own had stopped. This is really a nuisance and realme should never make it so hard for us to remove unwanted apps. Giving ads is one thing, but this is outright attacking people with ads, which is not at all a pleasant experience. There are some app groups called hot games and hot apps which are stupid and came back even after I disabled them twice. Eventually I was able to remove them for good. Only one tip for you- disable and remove network access for the realme app store and you can hopefully uninstall unwanted apps. There were no native keyboard applications (like Xiaomi), thankfully.

Verdict- a good option for people with limited budget and needs. There is nothing amazing (except for battery life), but the phone is perfectly usable and fast enough to not being called a slow phone. The UI has good features but infected with ads. I believe premium offerings of realme don't have this problem. Not for people who love ad-free stock Android experience. But gets the job done with little money. Better than the lower budjet (6k-8k) phones. I will give 3.7 out of 5.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-Segment-Fastest-Charging-High-res/dp/B0BZ48H8JX/ref=sr_1_19?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-19
Vasanth,Blend of good and bad,Reviewed in India on 11 May 2023,"TOP GOOD THINGS I LIKE

1) Phone is designed well for this price segment. Even though it is plastic we feel little premium.

2) User interface is also much better. I love the way icons are designed. A good job done by realme UI 4.0

3) Some special features like dual audio, mini caplsule, sleep capsule add uniqueness to this phone.

TOP BAD THINGS I HATE:

1) Most review said Camera is average but for me I am putting camera performance in below average position. Especially front camera is not worth for this price segment too.

2) Display is average. Previously also I used same IPS LCD display but while comparing, this display is poor.

3) Performace is little slower. Even I don't have large size apps like gaming apps. Using basic apps itself slower in this phone.

BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD:

1) Price - I am not sure about this price is okay or not for this phone. But somewhat I feel okay.

2) Speaker - Many phone under this price give dual speaker now-a-days but here it is provided with single speaker at the bottom. It's okay really sounds good. But my problem is the special feature ""200% volume"" is total waste. You can hear only noise not a quality sound. It is purely a gimmick.

3) Battery - As I told already, I just have basic app not a single games app. Battery is average. But recharge fastly.

CONCLUSION:

1) If you are new to smart phone. This phone is okay for you.

2) If you expecting a best phone in this price segment. Please refer some other phones, compare and decide. If you need good camera phone don't buy this. If you need good display phone compare other phone in this price segment.

3) If you need a good realme UI experience in this price segment just order and get yours.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-Segment-Fastest-Charging-High-res/dp/B0BZ48H8JX/ref=sr_1_19?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-19

Samir Gadhave,Performance,Reviewed in India on 25 July 2023,"I recently got my hands on the Realme N55, and while it has some notable features, it's not without its downsides.

**Pros:**

1. **Decent Performance:** The phone's performance is okay for everyday tasks and light gaming. It handles most apps without much trouble, but don't expect it to be a powerhouse for heavy tasks.

2. **Good Display:** The display is bright and colorful, making it enjoyable for watching videos and browsing content.

3. **Camera Quality:** The camera does a decent job in well-lit conditions, capturing reasonably detailed photos. The AI enhancements can be hit or miss, but it's fine for casual photography.

4. **Battery Life:** The battery life is satisfactory, getting me through a full day with moderate use.

**Cons:**

1. **Build Quality:** While the design looks premium, the build quality is not up to par. The plastic back feels a bit cheap and is prone to scratches.

2. **Performance under Load:** The phone struggles with demanding tasks and heavy multitasking. It tends to slow down and lag, which can be frustrating.

3. **Low-light Camera:** The camera performance takes a hit in low-light conditions. The images lack detail and can be quite grainy.

4. **Bloatware:** The device comes preloaded with a fair amount of bloatware, which can't be easily removed. It's annoying to have apps you don't need taking up space and resources.

5. **Software Updates:** The software updates are inconsistent, and sometimes it takes a while to receive the latest Android version or security patches.

**Conclusion:**

The Realme N55 is an affordable option with some good aspects, but it's not without its flaws. It's suitable for casual users who don't need a lot of processing power or are on a tight budget. However, if you're looking for a more robust and reliable smartphone, you might want to explore other options in the market. Keep your expectations in check, and you'll find the Realme N55 to be a decent entry-level device.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-Segment-Fastest-Charging-High-res/dp/B0BZ48H8JX/ref=sr_1_19?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-19

Reshma Narkhede,Decent Phone with Some Drawbacks,Reviewed in India on 7 September 2023,"I recently purchased the Realme Narzo N55 in the Prime Black variant with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. While it has some impressive features, I have mixed feelings about this smartphone.

Pros:
1. **Super Fast Charging:** The 33W fast charging is a game-changer. It charges the phone rapidly, and I never have to worry about running out of battery during the day.

2. **Stunning Camera:** The 64MP primary AI camera does deliver high-resolution photos with good clarity and color reproduction. It's a great choice for photography enthusiasts.

3. **Ample Storage:** With 128GB of internal storage, I have plenty of space for all my apps, photos, and videos. No need to constantly delete files to make room.

Cons:
1. **Software Issues:** The phone occasionally suffers from software glitches. It freezes and lags at times, which can be frustrating. I hope Realme releases updates to address these issues.

2. **Average Display:** The display is decent, but not exceptional. Colors are somewhat muted, and outdoor visibility could be better. It falls short compared to some competitors in this price range.

3. **Build Quality:** While the phone feels sturdy, it's a bit on the bulky side. It's not the most comfortable phone to hold for extended periods, and the design could be more ergonomic.

4. **Bloatware:** Realme preloads quite a bit of bloatware on the device. It takes up storage space and clutters the interface. Some of these apps cannot be uninstalled.

Overall, the Realme Narzo N55 has its strengths, particularly in terms of fast charging and camera performance. However, it also has its fair share of shortcomings, including software issues and build quality. Whether it's the right phone for you depends on your priorities. If you value camera quality and fast charging, it might be worth considering. However, if you prioritize a smooth, hassle-free experience, you might want to explore other options in this price range.",https://www.amazon.in/realme-Segment-Fastest-Charging-High-res/dp/B0BZ48H8JX/ref=sr_1_19?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-19

Mushtaq,Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features,Reviewed in India on 3 August 2023,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇

*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***

Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.

Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.

I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performance

Front and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.

Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.

Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.

Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.

Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.

Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.

Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.

Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.
Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.

Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.

I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.

Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.

As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.

If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.

But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.

In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.
I couldn't find a phone which has:

Super AmoLed Bright display.
6000 mAh battery.
OIS camera.
120hz Refresh Rate.
4 years of OS (stock Android like) updates
Decent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)
5G with several bands.

It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.

Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-sAMOLED-Display-Battery-Security/dp/B0C7C1DRK5/ref=sr_1_20?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-20
vm,Good Everyday Use Phone,Reviewed in India on 1 August 2023,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.

It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.

Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.

Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.

Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.

Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.

Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.

Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.

If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.

I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.

Overall a nice deal !",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-sAMOLED-Display-Battery-Security/dp/B0C7C1DRK5/ref=sr_1_20?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-20
Biswajit Behera,Honest Review After 3 months of use,Reviewed in India on 31 July 2023,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.

( After 3 months am updating the review again below)

October Update: -
During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discount

My requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.

Cons or Disadvantages: -
1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)

2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.

3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic. Using Snapchat filter for good selfie
One more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.
Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile camera
Back camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there

4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available
5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .
After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds

6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respond

No more cons I found till date. I ll update later.

Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )

2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it

3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.

4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)
Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.

5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug in

Suggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.

If your priorities is display and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )

Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)

Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.

Thank you...❤️",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-sAMOLED-Display-Battery-Security/dp/B0C7C1DRK5/ref=sr_1_20?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-20
Sourya Gourab Nanda,Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.,Reviewed in India on 12 October 2023,"Hello!!
this is Sourya Gourab,
today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......
👉... PROS ...👈
▪️1) CAMERA:- the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍
▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔 honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.
▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍
▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.
👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/- is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍
▪️5) BATTERY🔋:- 6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.
But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc.....
❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️
▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!! KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇
SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....
I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️. Regards
Sourya Gourab Nanda

Namit Singh,Almost a 5 star review but somethings held me back,Reviewed in India on 16 November 2023,"The phone itself is amazing to touch and to feel.
The color midnight blue looks absolutely stunning. Very easy to setup and seamless data transferring from the old device.
The size of the phone is handy and not too big or small, I would the perfect size.
For the display all I need to say is that it is a Samsung display. Such a vibrant and good looking display, love it.
Didn't face any kind of lag or stuttering, the ram management is also pretty good.
The cameras too are pretty decent, daylight photography would yield good photos and in night the quality would go down but still so much better than other phones in this segment. Loved the cameras too 💥
The updates too are amazing, 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of security updates.
Speakers are loud too, with a decent amount of bass and clarity.
5g works well if you live in a metropolitan area, where 5g is available throughout.
The phone feels sturdy and durable.

Now why not 5 stars...
1) the phone gets hot, use too much camera the phone will get hot, use the phone for a really long time 3-4 hours it will get hot even in the winters.
2) the design is not the latest but will suffice. Still Samsung should have given a punch hole display.",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-sAMOLED-Display-Battery-Security/dp/B0C7C1DRK5/ref=sr_1_20?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-20
Sameep Girdher,Good Smartphone for Multitasking but it can freeze a bit if you put high load by opening many apps .,Reviewed in India on 13 November 2023,"I like it for day to day life as i'm not a gamer

Pros-
1.Its good for people with concern of battery backup as it has 1.5 to 2 day backup.

2.You should prefer 8gb 128gb minimum variant as there will be 4 OS updates and to handle that 8gb minimum ram should be required.

3.Also, camera quality is good and on top of that 120 hz Amoled Full Hd+ display is top notch.

Cons-
1. Not suitable for high end gaming , you can play games but not at highest graphics , standard graphics is preferred.

2.Some time get overheated due to excessive gaming or playing at high resoluion.

3. Fingerprint sensor is not that fast but decent.",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-sAMOLED-Display-Battery-Security/dp/B0C7C1DRK5/ref=sr_1_20?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-20
Kindle Customer,One of the best phones in mid range price band,Reviewed in India on 5 November 2023,"Samsung is one of my favorite brands in Android smartphone segment, I have used C9, J7 prime, A50, A80, S21. Have also purchased A7 & A10 for a family member. I was looking to buy a mid range phone and this is one of the best phones in mid range prices with 4 Android and 5 yrs security updates. Samsung is known for a good display and awesome cameras however this device scores low as per my expectations. Another plus is powerful battery which lasts for more than a day if the usage is normal. One of the BIGGEST drawback, it's heavy and thicker as compared to the current generation of smartphones and may discourage buyers. So if you are looking for lighter and thinner phones, this may not be the right phone for you.",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-sAMOLED-Display-Battery-Security/dp/B0C7C1DRK5/ref=sr_1_20?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-20

2. 6000mah battery is best if you disable 5g connectivity. M34 uses 5nm processor which consumes less battery. Charging takes around 2 hours 20 minutes.

1. Battery? Yes. 6000 mah. Will comfortably work for 36+ hrs. SOT(about 10 hrs). It has Battery protect feature. More than enough.
2. Display? 120 hz super amoled. More than enough.
3. Software? One UI 5.1 flagship level. All features and customization available. With good lock you get everything. Android 13 out of the box.
4. Updates? 4 years OS + 5 years security. More than enough
5. Knox security.
6. Samsung wallet with nfc.
7. Simple. Durable.
8. If you compare with other Chinese phones, goes are assembled phone. But Samsung has its own chipset(not the best one), camera sensors(good), display(very good) hence these very well co-ordinated.

Pulkit,Buy only for your dad or mom,Reviewed in India on 9 October 2023,"All YouTube reviews are fake. They all get paid for it

Pros

Let's First talk about camera and screen the main highlights of screen
They all appreciated camera alot but it's not even close to hype gives yellowish tone to each photo like a cheap smartphone not eyepleasing at all
Display is good acc to price but you can tell the difference only when put side to side with another smartphone otherwise all display gives similar view in this price range
So not worth buying only for display

Now price i bought it for 15000
So I should be comparing it with other 15000rs smartphones but not you should go for Smartphone around 17000 because 15000₹ for smartphone + 1500 for charger + 200 cover and screen guard= 16700 ( other brands give all this with smartphone)

So all the best things about this phone camera display price , in actual are not that good all this is gimmick so only buy this phone for your parents who doesn't have long screentime as it has big battery, 4 years of updates

Cons
Took 2 hours too charge that's is way too long
Processor is not that good as you already know
Not worth the price there are better option in less price
Ugly drop notch chin ( though Mobile looks good you may call somewhat premium if chin is ignored)

If you are getting this with charger under 15k and not that fond of gaming and whitish photos ( pictures that makes you look fair) then you can go for it",https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-sAMOLED-Display-Battery-Security/dp/B0C7C1DRK5/ref=sr_1_20?keywords=mobile&qid=1700642605&sr=8-20

Inflation affects a lot.
So, Buy only 8GB+256GB variant because hybrid simslot and no esim support buy 8GB+256GB which only make sense.

1k for charger it's a huge price.

Connectivity- 5G is stable I tested with Airtel 5g and speed is awesome.

Heating- No heating issue

Performence- Phone performs smoothly in all apps. Sometimes jitters at the time of heavy multitasking. This phone is not for high end gaming

Camera- The best camera under 20k

Battery - Battery is 6000 mah but it feels like 5000, It's okay normal.

Display- No comparison in display, it's awesome

One ui- The full one ui is so much usefully in daily office tasks. It packs uncountable features for you.

MIMO,Great 👍,Reviewed in India on 8 November 2023,"I brought this phone under 51K with bank offer.
Camera quality of this phone is awesome, some pictures samples with various light condition that I give, see it and judge it.
Processor is decent compared to snapdragon 8 gen like 10-15% less. Every phone heated during camera recording and high graphics game playing because since 2012 to current time I brought more than 10 Mobiles with various brand and processor so I know how much these phone heated.
If I compared to Snapdragon to Exynos there is slightly heated like if SD heat upto 37-40 C during video recording/gaming at same time Exynos heat 39-43 C that's it. I saw if phone's body is plastic then feeling of heat slightly less time than when the phone body made of glass or Alluminium. Its 3.9x cooling chamber cool down quickly this phone.
But day to day use it doesn't feel you heat so much.
This phone come with Standard and Light mode which means first mode prefer only performance where you use 120Hz refresh rate and 5G connectivity and second one prefer to battery backup so there you can't use 5G and 120Hz.
This phone come with 4500mAh battery I think it should be more mAh capacity at this price. But day to day normal uses its backup upto 7hr but if you are a heavy user then it will change two times in a day.
Software and UI experience is very good and comfortable than other phones UI, No blotware. Display experience is awesome with HDR 10+ and Knox sequrity which make this phone more premium.
I think if you are a heavy gammer and your priority only performance then you can skip it. Otherwise I prefer you buy it only when it comes with bank offer.
Thank you 😊",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo3MDE1NDgwNTI0ODY5MDoxNzAwNjQyNjA1OnNwX2J0ZjozMDAwNjY2NTQ3MTcxMzI6OjA6Og&url=%2FSamsung-Galaxy-Purple-128GB-Storage%2Fdp%2FB0CJ4TFLTT%2Fref%3Dsr_1_22_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dmobile%26qid%3D1700642605%26sr%3D8-22-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9idGY%26psc%3D1
CHANCHAL BASU,1 month review,Reviewed in India on 11 November 2023,"Ordered it on the day of launch. Got it delivered same day. My criteria for selecting this phone:
1) camera
2) Big battery with wireless charging
3) made in india
4) non Chinese brand
5) Under 50 Th after offers

I am a business user and use my phone for Teams calls, emails, music, WA, FB etc. So not a very heavy user.
My experience in the last month:
PROS:
1) very easy to move all data from my previous one plus 5T
2) camera is decent in this range. Nothing to boast.
3) Screen and touch are awesome
4) wireless charging works like a charm
5) gets charged quickly
CONS:
1) Doesn't come with charger adapter. Had to research to find and order a compatible charger
2) Has no memory card slot. Actually no good options available for dual Sim phones with dedicated card slot
3) Looks are killer but some feel it looks like iPhone.
4) Heating happens during charging. Some heating during continuous use.
5) Camera results could have been better

Will update if new issues show up after few months.",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo3MDE1NDgwNTI0ODY5MDoxNzAwNjQyNjA1OnNwX2J0ZjozMDAwNjY2NTQ3MTcxMzI6OjA6Og&url=%2FSamsung-Galaxy-Purple-128GB-Storage%2Fdp%2FB0CJ4TFLTT%2Fref%3Dsr_1_22_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dmobile%26qid%3D1700642605%26sr%3D8-22-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9idGY%26psc%3D1

Dhanasekar,Heating Machine for Normal User,Reviewed in India on 12 November 2023,"Hi,
After 20 days usage I am writing this review.
Cons:
1. Beside Pros, Cons are in higher side.
2. For outdoor usage, phone is heating like anything and I can't able to use. Just turning on Power mode and Extra dim at high intensity.
3. Dialer is not optimised for latest version, it is frequently auto restarting (you need to wait for 30 mins for next use). During concall it is getting call drop some times.
4. Batter life is not appreciable, need to charge at 4 or 5PM if you start using phone from 9AM for indoor use. But in outdoor, you need to charge at 2PM or push to use Deep power mode.
5. While phone was in Power saving mode, after unlock, phone refresh rate is strucking for 2 swipes, after that it is normal.
6. 50MP camera shots clarity is less in compare to normal 12MP camera shots.
6. While charging also, phone is heating like anything.
7. In Samsung Members app, i have raised complaint of plenty of times on above issues, they are providing only basic solutions which is of no use.
8. While you are in call, screen touch or awake is majority of times not working need to touch three or more times or have to use side button.
9. Dont keep the mobile in light mode, you will face excess heating during normal usage. Better keep it in Standard mode.
10. But Samsung putting USP as provided vapour chamber for cooling, but dont know whether that is working or not.

Literally I am putting my mobile in front of Car AC vent for immediate cooling during usage.

Pros:
1. Good screen quality
2. Call clarity is good
3. Speaker sound is good
4. Wifi speed is good
5. Haptic is good.

Hope all these issues may solve in UI 6.0 update.

NIRUPAM,Comparison with oneplus11,Reviewed in India on 6 November 2023,"Going through the hardware and software part, anyone can see and establish that, any customer gets less by almost 20-25 percent, in overall comparison. For the Brand name of Samsung and delivering it more profits. While A customer gains over almost every aspect this much extra at same price, not to forget, the second in line product launched in India by Samsung viewers remember Snapdragon gen 2 processor was initially not delivered on this phone by Samsung. This will definitely provide a weaker performance atleast by 10 to 15 percent for sure. compared to its rival competition in price over oneplus11 only extra feature is NFC that is a coil loop to magnetically transfer charge to s23. Being a Chip manufacturer itself, Samsung, does not supply charger and even wired or wireless earphones.
Thus a big no for Samsung brand phones.",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo3MDE1NDgwNTI0ODY5MDoxNzAwNjQyNjA1OnNwX2J0ZjozMDAwNjY2NTQ3MTcxMzI6OjA6Og&url=%2FSamsung-Galaxy-Purple-128GB-Storage%2Fdp%2FB0CJ4TFLTT%2Fref%3Dsr_1_22_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dmobile%26qid%3D1700642605%26sr%3D8-22-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9idGY%26psc%3D1

Display clarity is excellent and one of the best in the range.
